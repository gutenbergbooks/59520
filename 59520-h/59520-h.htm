<p class='c009'>Prisons as places of detention are very ancient
institutions. As soon as men had learned the
way to build, in stone, as in Egypt, or with
bricks, as in Mesopotamia, when kings had
many-towered fortresses, and the great barons
castles on the crags, there would be cells and
dungeons in the citadels.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a> But prisons as places
for the reception of “ordinary” (as distinct from
state or political) criminals for definite terms
only evolved in England many centuries afterwards<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a>;
whilst imprisonment as a punishment in
itself,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a> to be endured under rules made expressly
punitive and distressful, may be described as
essentially modern, and reached its worst phase
in the nineteenth century.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The Teutonic Tribes of the bays and forests
were fierce and free. They exemplified, in fact,
the theory of Nietzsche, that liberty cannot be
granted but must be taken.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c010'><sup>[5]</sup></a> They had not
cowered before Oriental superstitions,<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c010'><sup>[6]</sup></a> and as
they lived in widely scattered hordes a central
government could not impose its yoke upon the
savage warriors. With the wild clansmen of
the fierce Norse nations, where every man was
always ready armed<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c010'><sup>[7]</sup></a> and boys received their
weapons at fifteen,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c010'><sup>[8]</sup></a> the great desideratum was
the maintenance of peace.</p>

<p class='c011'>The instinct of retaliation throbs in all men,
and vengeance swift and bloody would be sought
for, which, where the kindred ties were close and
strong, might spread a feud through villages
and clans, such that the very children might be
born devoted to the duty of a family revenge.
The Teutonic nations, like the free peoples they
were, always assumed that for a crime to have
been committed, an individual must have suffered
injury.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c010'><sup>[9]</sup></a> And they conceived the aggrieved
plaintiff as no cowed weakling (or he would not
have counted), but as a fighting freeman with
spear and shield, who would repay a wrong with
interest, and whom, if slain, his kinsmen would
avenge.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus the placation<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c010'><sup>[10]</sup></a> of the injured party was
the objective of the oldest laws. Allowance
was made for human feelings<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c010'><sup>[11]</sup></a> and impulses.
Some ancient codes<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c010'><sup>[12]</sup></a> permitted him like for like;
an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, in
the sense of so much, and no more.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c010'><sup>[13]</sup></a> But the
Teutonic laws offered him compensation,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c010'><sup>[14]</sup></a> and,
when it was possible, compelled him to accept it.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c010'><sup>[15]</sup></a>
Thus crimes were met by restitution, not by
punishment.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c010'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Every sort of injury which one freeman could
do to another was first of all atonable by bōt (a
money compensation paid to the injured man or
his relations).<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c010'><sup>[17]</sup></a> What this fine was depended
firstly upon the nature and extent of the damage
done, and secondly upon the rank and importance
of the person injured.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c010'><sup>[18]</sup></a> For every man had his
class and value; and every form of aggression
against a freeman, from a wound which killed
him outright to a blow which deprived him of
a single tooth,<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c010'><sup>[19]</sup></a> as well as the theft of anything
he possessed, had its appointed fine according to
his wer.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c010'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The tariffs varied with the different tribes,<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c010'><sup>[21]</sup></a>
but the main principle—of compensation—extends
through all. In Mercia the wer-gild
of a king was fixed at 7200 shillings or 120
Mercian pounds of silver,<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c010'><sup>[22]</sup></a> to which great sum
was added the cynebot of a similar amount
which was payable to his people.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c010'><sup>[23]</sup></a> The wer-gild
of a thane (<i>i.e.</i> county magnate) came to
1200 shillings, that of a ceorl (labourer) was 200
shillings.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c010'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>These murder-fines, however, were much
heavier than they look;<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c010'><sup>[25]</sup></a> those of the kings,<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c010'><sup>[26]</sup></a>
numerous as they were, would in most cases
have been hopelessly unpayable by private
people, and those of the thanes by humble
families. Even the wer-gild of the ceorl, or
labourer, which was 200 scillings, or about four
pounds, was not inconsiderable when we remember
that in Æthelstan’s time one scilling would buy
a sheep, and six scillings (or thirty pence)<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c010'><sup>[27]</sup></a> an
ox—the cost would be the price of a small herd.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c010'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>So that frequently the man-fines<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c010'><sup>[29]</sup></a> were never
paid, and then we perceive that the wise compensation
system of the codes arose more out of
the fear of the vendetta than from humane principles;<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c010'><sup>[30]</sup></a>
if they were not paid, vengeance would
be let loose.</p>

<p class='c011'>If the offender were not slain or abused,<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c010'><sup>[31]</sup></a>
if he did not escape and live as an outlaw
and a “wolf’s head”<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c010'><sup>[32]</sup></a> (which was frequently
done,<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c010'><sup>[33]</sup></a> for there were some ten men outlawed<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c010'><sup>[34]</sup></a>
to every one hanged<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c010'><sup>[35]</sup></a>), he might be sold<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c010'><sup>[36]</sup></a> as a
wite theow<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c010'><sup>[37]</sup></a> into penal slavery.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c010'><sup>[38]</sup></a> For there were
slaves as a class in Christendom and in England
up to the twelfth century,<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c010'><sup>[39]</sup></a> and they being
helpless, like our “submerged” masses, were of
little account at all in the community.</p>

<p class='c011'>Derived mainly from the conquered taken in
wars and raids,<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c010'><sup>[40]</sup></a> their ranks were recruited by
men sold for their offences, and likewise, it is
said, from those who sold themselves in times
of starvation;<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c010'><sup>[41]</sup></a> many were sent as slaves beyond
the seas,<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c010'><sup>[42]</sup></a> and the fact that we find this custom
repeatedly prohibited<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c010'><sup>[43]</sup></a> testifies also to its
prevalence.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c010'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>From the poor slaves there need be no fear of
vengeance or retaliation; they were a voteless
minority amidst Saxon freemen. If a slave
were slain only eight shillings were payable to
his kinsfolk,<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c010'><sup>[45]</sup></a> while a man-bōt of thirty shillings
was claimed by his master.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c010'><sup>[46]</sup></a> And that, it would
seem, was all on the part of the State.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c010'><sup>[47]</sup></a> The
Church, however, to its credit, imposed a
penance, a two years’ fast.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c010'><sup>[48]</sup></a> Other injuries to
the theow (slave) were treated with proportional
mildness,<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c010'><sup>[49]</sup></a> but of Church laws and discipline I
shall have to speak presently.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c010'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>For the damage done by his slave the master
was liable,<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c010'><sup>[51]</sup></a> as for a trespass by his cattle.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c010'><sup>[52]</sup></a> For
the more serious offences the theow would be
handed over to the kinsfolk of the injured party,
unless perchance his master should redeem him
by payment.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c010'><sup>[53]</sup></a> If upon accusation he failed at
the ordeal, he was to be forthwith branded the
first time;<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c010'><sup>[54]</sup></a> but the second conviction would be
capital, “seconda vice non compenset aliquid nisi
caput.”<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c010'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Apart from legal or revengeful penalties for
wrongs done to any freeman,<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c010'><sup>[56]</sup></a> the theow was
absolutely at the mercy of his master.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c010'><sup>[57]</sup></a> If he
were not allowed to “redeem his hide” by such
small compensation or atonement of which he
was capable, he might have one leg fastened by
a ring to a stake, round which he would be
lashed with a three-thonged whip.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c010'><sup>[58]</sup></a> It was
composed of cords knotted at the ends.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c010'><sup>[59]</sup></a> If a
ceorl were goaded into homicide, vengeance
might then be taken upon six of his kinsfolk<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c010'><sup>[60]</sup></a>
(upon the principle that the thane had six times
his value,<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c010'><sup>[61]</sup></a> see wer-gilds, <i>ante</i>, and Maitland,
<i>Domesday Book</i>, p. 53). If a theow killed his
lord<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c010'><sup>[62]</sup></a> he was to perish in torments;<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c010'><sup>[63]</sup></a> for revenge
was sweet,<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c010'><sup>[64]</sup></a> and the strong took it without stint.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c010'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Clearly, then, from the nature of early Saxon
society, elaborate penal machinery had no place.
The freemen atoned for their transgressions with
fines when possible, and by slavery, mutilation,
outlawry, or death when they could not pay.
Cruelly as the slaves might be flogged or
slaughtered, there were no prisons in the land
even for them.<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c010'><sup>[66]</sup></a> The villages were mere groups
of wooden homesteads with barns and cattle sheds
surrounded by rough stockades and destitute of
roads or communications. Even the palace of
the king was a long wooden hall with numerous
outhouses, for the English built no stone houses
and burnt down those of their Roman predecessors.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c010'><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The Teutons, according to Tacitus, abhorred
walled towns as the defences of slavery and the
graves of freedom. The Frisians forbade the
construction of any walls more than 12 feet
high.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c010'><sup>[68]</sup></a> In the course of time the crown, or
central government, grew in power; the king,
and even the great lords, spiritual and temporal,
were able to enforce obedience and order, at
any rate upon those in their neighbourhood.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c010'><sup>[69]</sup></a>
The royal authority could defy the vendetta,
and from very early times had claimed a share
in the compensation,<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c010'><sup>[70]</sup></a> so that, along with the
wer-gild, payable to the injured party, the wite,
or additional fine, had to be paid to the sovereign
(or overlord) for the disturbance of his peace.<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c010'><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Sometimes he would take vengeance for the
State or for an aggrieved person.<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c010'><sup>[72]</sup></a> Thus in the
reign of Æthelstan a man might forfeit his
hand for coining, and have it nailed over the
door of the mint;<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c010'><sup>[73]</sup></a> and in the reign of Cnut
a woman might lose her nose and ears if she
committed adultery. In the early period these
mutilations appear to have often been intended
to be mortal, for in the laws of Alfred and
Guthrum we read that “If a malefactor, having
forfeited himself, has had a limb cut off, and, being
left to himself, survive the third night; afterwards
he that is willing to take care of his sore and
soul may help him with the Bishop’s leave.”<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c010'><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>But the maimed criminals were also allowed
at large to be a living warning to others. That
the Saxons could be cruel enough when bōt was
not made, and to habitual criminals and slaves,
we have seen already; how barbarous the amputations
were may be gleaned from the words
of our Danish monarch: “... At the second
time let there be no other bōt if he be foul” (at
the ordeal) “than that his hands be cut off or
his feet, or both according as the deed may be,
and if then he have wrought yet greater wrong,
then let his eyes be put out, or his nose and his
ears and the upper lip be cut off; or let him be
scalped ... so that punishment be inflicted
and also the soul preserved.”<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c010'><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>William the Norman enjoined that offenders
should not be slain outright, but hacked about.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c010'><sup>[76]</sup></a>
“Interdicimus,” he commands, “eciam ne quis
occidatur vel suspendatur pro aliqua culpa sed
enerventur oculi, et abscindantur pedes vel testiculi,
vel manus ita quod truncus remaneat vivus
in signum prodicionis et nequicie sue.”<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c010'><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>About the tenth century, after the ending of
the Danish troubles, and in the eleventh under
the Norman rule, the king was strong enough
to extend his power and protection.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c010'><sup>[78]</sup></a> In the
twelfth the old system of bōt and wer, designed
to compensate the injured and keep the peace
among a fierce and warlike race of freemen,<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c010'><sup>[79]</sup></a>
began to give place to one under which the king
exacted punishment and tribute,<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c010'><sup>[80]</sup></a> which he
administered and collected through itinerant
judges, sheriffs, and other officers.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c010'><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The heavy fines imposed on places and
people<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c010'><sup>[82]</sup></a> became an important source of revenue
to the crown<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c010'><sup>[83]</sup></a> and to the barons and the lords of
manors<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c010'><sup>[84]</sup></a> when they held rights of private jurisdiction<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c010'><sup>[85]</sup></a>
(Sake and Soke, Courts Leet,<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c010'><sup>[86]</sup></a> etc.),
which were frequently delegated.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c010'><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The State was growing strong enough to take
vengeance; the common man was no longer
feared as had been the well-armed Saxon citizen
of old, and to the “common” criminal was
extended the ruthless severity once reserved for
the slaves.<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c010'><sup>[88]</sup></a> Then likewise Glanville and the
lawyers,<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c010'><sup>[89]</sup></a> under the influence of Rome and
Constantinople, drew a sharp and arbitrary
distinction between the criminal and the civil
pleas, and the idea of compensation began to
wane before the revenge instinct now backed by
power. If there was money obtainable, the
king’s judges would seize it;<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c010'><sup>[90]</sup></a> the idea of damage
done to the individual was merged and lost
in the greater trespass<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c010'><sup>[91]</sup></a> alleged to have been
committed by the offender against the peace,
against the code and king.</p>

<p class='c011'>Up to the middle of the twelfth century<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c010'><sup>[92]</sup></a>
some counties were without public gaols or
prisoners’ cages,<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c010'><sup>[93]</sup></a> and Henry II. commanded their
construction at the Assize of Clarendon, 1166.
By the seventh article<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c010'><sup>[94]</sup></a> gaols were to be made
in the walled towns or erected within royal
castles<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c010'><sup>[95]</sup></a> with the king’s timber or other wood
that might be available.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c010'><sup>[96]</sup></a> They were evidently
light improvised structures<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c010'><sup>[97]</sup></a>—sheds knocked up
beneath massive walls of city or castle. The
king’s strong places or the larger monasteries
would be prisonous enough with little alteration.
These early prisons of the Angevin kings were
collecting depots or remand prisons for the safe
custody of persons accused. Bracton, who died
in 1268, expressly wrote that prison was to
confine and not to punish.<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c010'><sup>[98]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Bishop Britton<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c010'><sup>[99]</sup></a> (thirteenth century) says
that only those accused of felony were to be kept
in irons, and none were to be ill-treated except
according to sentence. In the <i>Mirror of Justice</i>
we read that “every common prison<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c010'><sup>[100]</sup></a> is a gaol,
and only the king has the keeping of it<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c010'><sup>[101]</sup></a>; every
other man’s prison is private, etc.; and because it
is forbidden that any one be tormented before
judgment, the law wills that no one be placed
among vermin and putrefaction, or in any horrible
or dangerous place, or in the water, or in the
dark, or any other torment; but it is lawful for
gaolers to put fetters upon those whom they
suspect of trying to escape, but the fetters must
not weigh more than 12 oz....”<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c010'><sup>[102]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The captives having been collected together
within the gaols would have to wait till the next
assize. It might be a long time—months (as
even now) or years<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c010'><sup>[103]</sup></a>—for the king’s judges were
dreaded—and of those who could not get mainpernors
(bail),<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c010'><sup>[104]</sup></a> many would die of want or disease
before the justices were ready to try them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile the prisoners and their families
were to be kept at their own expense; according
to Bishop Britton<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c010'><sup>[105]</sup></a> the gaoler was required to take
nothing from the poor—who would in general
possess nothing to be taken—and not more than
fourpence for the keep of any prisoner.<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c010'><sup>[106]</sup></a> None
were to be detained from inability to pay the
fees. Such were the rules approved by Edward
I. In practice, it appears probable that, for the
next five hundred years or so, the prisoners
would be well fed if they had means, and might
be starved to death if they had not.<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c010'><sup>[107]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Those who survived until the opening of the
court would be brought up, according to Bracton,<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c010'><sup>[108]</sup></a>
with their hands free, though sometimes in leg-irons.
We find the description amplified by
Britton;<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c010'><sup>[109]</sup></a> they were to be “barefooted, uncoifed
and bareheaded, in their coat only, without irons
of any kind,<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c010'><sup>[110]</sup></a> so that they might not be deprived
of reason by pain, nor be constrained to answer
by force.”<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c010'><sup>[111]</sup></a> But thus far no punishments had
been meted out; these followed upon conviction,
and were of a physical and sanguinary character.</p>

<p class='c011'>According to Bracton an offender might be
broken on the wheel for treason, a crime so great
that it was scarcely to be permitted that the
relations should live.<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c010'><sup>[112]</sup></a> For the “common”
criminal there was hanging,<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c010'><sup>[113]</sup></a> and the ghastly
mutilations enjoined by the Norman kings were
continued; indeed they were made more savage
for many offences after 1176.<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c010'><sup>[114]</sup></a> Up to the reign
of Henry III. the penalty for poaching in the
king’s forests was death or the loss of eyesight.<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c010'><sup>[115]</sup></a>
Rape up to the reign of Edward I. might also
involve loss of eyes and emasculation.<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c010'><sup>[116]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Stealing from a dwelling appears to have
met with the same barbarous punishment. A
glimpse of the gentle ways of twelfth-century
“justice” is revealed in an account of a supposed
miracle. A certain Ailward, being accused of
housebreaking (committed apparently under considerable
provocation to recover a debt), was
lodged for some time in Bedford Prison.<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c010'><sup>[117]</sup></a> After
having failed in the water ordeal and being
convicted, he was taken out to the usual place
of punishment, where his eyes were blinded, he
was mutilated, and the parts were buried in
the ground. He is said to have been restored
through St. Thomas of Canterbury.</p>

<p class='c011'>By the time of Edward I. we begin to arrive
at sentences of imprisonment, and read of such
penalties as one year and then a fine, or two
years in default of fine, in the first Statutes of
Westminster. For such offences as carrying off
a nun, allowing a prisoner to evade prison, or
stealing tame beasts out of parks, a sentence
of three years might be awarded besides the
customary fine. As we have seen, the profits
of “justice” were highly regarded; the fines
were precious perquisites of the Crown (and
sometimes of subordinate administrators and
officials as well). The prisons were used as
“squeezers” to extort them. “Imprisonment,”
say Pollock and Maitland,<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c010'><sup>[118]</sup></a> “was, as a general
rule, but preparatory to a fine. After a year or
two the wrongdoer might make fine; if he had
no money he was detained for a while longer.
In the thirteenth century the king’s justices
wield a wide ‘common law’ power of ordering
that an offender be kept in custody. They have
an equally wide power of discharging him upon
his making a fine with the king.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In Henry III.’s reign “The wrongdoer but
rarely goes to prison, even for a moment.<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c010'><sup>[119]</sup></a> On
the plea roll the <i>custodiatur</i> which sends him
to gaol is followed at once by ‘Finem fecit per
unam markam’ (or whatever the sum might be),
and then come the names of those who are
pledges for the payment. The justices do not
wish to keep him in prison; they wish to make
him pay money.” The authors just quoted say
that the fines were generally light, and give
several instances<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c010'><sup>[120]</sup></a>—it doubtless depended much
upon the judges and the reign. But wherever
there are enclosing walls, there are certain to be
abuses behind them.<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c010'><sup>[121]</sup></a> Judicial and administrative
scandals kept on occurring.<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c010'><sup>[122]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>In the fourteenth century many persons are
said to have perished of hunger and thirst,<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c010'><sup>[123]</sup></a> and
many died in prison about the time of the
Black Death (1349).<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c010'><sup>[124]</sup></a> Into the fifteenth century
the complaints continue; we read the following
in the <i>Liber Albus</i>:<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c010'><sup>[125]</sup></a> “Whereas great outcry has
been made heretofore as to many wrongs and
misprisons done by the gaolers of Newgate and
Ludgate and their officers and servants, ...”
and new regulations were made (and no doubt
broken, as the others had been) respecting fees
the prisoners should pay.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sixteenth century showed no advance in
the matter of humanity.<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c010'><sup>[126]</sup></a> Torture, which, legally
or illegally, has always been a ready trick of
statesmen, developed after 1468,<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c010'><sup>[127]</sup></a> and under the
Tudor sovereigns the rack was ever creaking to
extort confessions. The “common” criminals
were treated with the utmost severity; in 1530
an Act was passed by which all poisoners were
to be boiled alive.<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c010'><sup>[128]</sup></a> Burning was the penalty
appointed for heresy, high and petty treason<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c010'><sup>[129]</sup></a>
(<i>i.e.</i> murder of a husband by a wife, murder of
a master or mistress by a servant,<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c010'><sup>[130]</sup></a> and several
offences against the coin), and, unlike the
punishment of boiling, continued legal until
1790.<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c010'><sup>[131]</sup></a> The right hand might be taken off
before hanging for aggravated murder, or a
man might be hung in chains and left to perish.<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c010'><sup>[132]</sup></a>
There was the drawing and quartering in some
executions, and ordinary hangings were exceedingly
numerous.<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c010'><sup>[133]</sup></a> Men lost their hands for
exporting sheep and for libel,<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c010'><sup>[134]</sup></a> and there was
branding, etc., for perjury, and sometimes for
persistent vagrancy.<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c010'><sup>[135]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>A picture of the prisons has been left us in
a work of 1545. “I see,” observes the monk
whose complaint<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c010'><sup>[136]</sup></a> is given, “also a pytyful abuse
for presoners. O Lord God, their lodging is to
bad for hoggys, and as for their meat it is euil
enough for doggys, and yet, the Lord knoweth,
thei haue not enough thereof. Consyder, all ye
that be kyngs and lordys of presons, that inasmoch
as ye shut up any man from his meate, ye be
bound to giue him sufficyant fode for a man and
not for a dogge.” He further declares that the
charges were greater than any at the “dearest
inn in Ingland,” and says that men lay six and
seven years in prison before the oncoming of
their case.</p>

<p class='c011'>About the year 1552 the City authorities
selected what had been a palace at Bridewell<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c010'><sup>[137]</sup></a>
(given by Edward VI.) for (among other purposes)
locking up, employing, and (as heretofore,
according to Holinshed) whipping beggars,
prostitutes, and night-walkers of all sorts.<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c010'><sup>[138]</sup></a> Later
on similar detention places were also called
Bridewells, after the first one at Blackfriars just
alluded to. In 1597 they planned Houses of
Correction,<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c010'><sup>[139]</sup></a> and in 1609 it was ordered that they
should be builded in every county.<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c010'><sup>[140]</sup></a> Though
they became, in practice, one with the common
gaols, they lasted at least in name till 1865.<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c010'><sup>[141]</sup></a> But
to resume our survey of ordinary prisons. The
seventeenth century affords the usual evidence of
what walls can hide. The gaolers, as of old,
appear to have been all powerful;<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c010'><sup>[142]</sup></a> sometimes
friendly, often the reverse, always extortionate.
John Bunyan, during his twelve years’ incarceration,
was allowed to work for his family—for a
large part of the time in tolerable surroundings;
but while in the Gate House prison he
was charged huge fees.<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c010'><sup>[143]</sup></a> The prisoners hung
collecting bags out of their windows on Sunday
mornings.</p>

<p class='c011'>George Fox,<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c010'><sup>[144]</sup></a> the Quaker, agreed with the
keeper and his wife for meat and drink, chamber,
and other accommodation at a certain rate. But
he refers to one of their party being put “down
in the Doomesdale<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c010'><sup>[145]</sup></a> amongst the felons,” and this,
it appears, was a “noysome, filthy, stinking hole,
where was a puddle of ... and filth over their
shoes and the ... of the felons, and straw almost
broken to chaffe with their long lying thereon and
full of vermin, wherein is neither chimney nor
easing house.” Confirmatory evidence as to how
felons fared in 1667 may be deduced out of a
Statute of Charles II.<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c010'><sup>[146]</sup></a> “Whereas,” it says, “there
is not yet any sufficient provision made for the relief
and setting to work of poor and needy persons
committed to the common gaol for felony and
other misdemeanours, who many times perish before
their trial, and the poor there living idly and
unemployed become debauched and come forth
instructed in the practice of thievery and
lewdness,” etc.</p>

<p class='c011'>The excellent plan was proposed that the
profits of the prisoners’ labour should be placed
to their relief. But to find useful labour within
prison walls has always been a most difficult
problem, and the world outside was always far
too busy to see to it. The prisons of the
eighteenth century were very much like those
that had been before, but perhaps we know more
about them through the great work of John
Howard, <i>The State of the Prisons</i>. It is a matter
of history how that grim, conscientious Puritan
went where the ruling classes neither cared nor
dared to venture.<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c010'><sup>[147]</sup></a> For, besides the dreadful
stench which stuck to his notes and garments,
deep in the windowless (window tax), airless
rooms and dungeons through which he went,
down in the stale, cramped yards<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c010'><sup>[148]</sup></a>—when there
were any—without space or sun, and in which
even the supply of water was mostly beyond
the bounds and so inaccessible,<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c010'><sup>[149]</sup></a> rising amidst
the putrefaction of those places, there lurked the
dreaded typhus or gaol fever.</p>

<p class='c011'>It had always been about since prisons were
used, and sometimes proved the Nemesis of
neglect.<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c010'><sup>[150]</sup></a> In 1522, at the assize in the castle at
Cambridge,<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c010'><sup>[151]</sup></a> many of the knights and gentlemen
attending caught the infection from the “sauor
of the prisoners or the filthe of the house.”
Writing of the year 1577, we read in <i>Baker’s
Chronicle</i>:<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c010'><sup>[152]</sup></a> “About this time when the judges
sate at the Assize in Oxford, and one Rowland
Jenks, a bookseller, was questioned for speaking
opprobrious words against the queen, suddenly
they were surprised with a pestilent savour,
whether rising from the noisome smell of the
prisoners or from the damp of the ground is
uncertain; but all that were present, almost
every one, within forty hours died.” Much the
same happened at Exeter in 1586<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c010'><sup>[153]</sup></a> and at
Taunton in 1730, and some hundreds perished
at both these places.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thomas Allen, in his <i>History of London</i>,<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c010'><sup>[154]</sup></a>
relates that in 1750 “The Lord Mayor, some of
the aldermen, two of the judges, the under
sheriff, many lawyers, and a number of lookers-on,
died of the gaol distemper.” The prison was
afterwards cleansed! Howard asserts that in
1773–4 more people died from the gaol fever
than were executed in the kingdom;<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c010'><sup>[155]</sup></a> we lost
2000 sailors (criminals were often given the
choice between punishment and the services)
with the fleet in the war with America.<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c010'><sup>[156]</sup></a> He
quotes Lord Bacon as saying that the most
pernicious infection next to the plague is the
smell of the jail.<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c010'><sup>[157]</sup></a> Such were the mephitic dens
into which were cast men, women, and children
of all sorts; and there they would rot away or
survive, as the case might be, until the expiration
of their (generally short) sentences of imprisonment,
if they could pay the fees charged on their
coming out; or until they ultimately came up
for trial, after which they would either be
acquitted and discharged (again when they paid
the fees), or they would be convicted and transported
or executed.<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c010'><sup>[158]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The number of capital offences was truly
enormous. Onward from 1688 they steadily
increased,<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c010'><sup>[159]</sup></a> owing, as has been well remarked,
to the “unhappy facility afforded to legislation
by Parliamentary government.”<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c010'><sup>[160]</sup></a> Members who
could not become ministers, and who yet wanted
to do something, often had interest enough to
hang somebody, or at least to get a law passed
creating a new capital felony.<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c010'><sup>[161]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Thus through the ambitions of private
members and the general callousness of the
ruling class, the number of capital offences kept
ever growing, until, in theory, there were more
than two hundred of them.<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c010'><sup>[162]</sup></a> The law, however,
had overreached; rough and often most brutal
as the people of that day were, they would not
enforce the penalties provided,<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c010'><sup>[163]</sup></a> so that the
hangman’s ministrations were invoked for only
twenty-five classes of offences in London,<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c010'><sup>[164]</sup></a> and
for not more than thirty throughout England.<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c010'><sup>[165]</sup></a>
In fact, it was found that conscientious people
refused to prosecute for the lesser crimes, dreading
to have a share in taking life. But actually
the gallows load was heavy; an instance appeared
in a <i>Times</i><a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c010'><sup>[166]</sup></a> paragraph—18th January 1801—which
tells how a certain Andrew Branning, a
luckless urchin aged only thirteen, had broken
into a house and carried off a spoon. Others were
with him, but they ran away, and only he was
captured and brought to trial. His story ended
in two words, which were short and customary:
Guilty—Death. Thus transportation and the
extreme penalty kept clearing the prisons, but
those within them were the while exploited,
being entirely the prey and property of warders,
keepers, and assistant gaolers, all of whom made
the most of their positions—which might be given
out like pensions or be purchased<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c010'><sup>[167]</sup></a>—to wring out
fees<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c010'><sup>[168]</sup></a> and make their places pay;<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c010'><sup>[169]</sup></a> and having
what amounted to unlimited power, and being,
by the nature of their office, used and inured
to witnessing suffering, the gaolers,<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c010'><sup>[170]</sup></a> from the
beginning and right into the eighteenth century,
shrank from no means, however mediæval, by
which they could extract their fees and charges.<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c010'><sup>[171]</sup></a>
Thumbscrews and iron skull-caps were sometimes
used,<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c010'><sup>[172]</sup></a> and were produced in court as
evidence.<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c010'><sup>[173]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Prisoners might be loaded with heavy irons
unless they would pay to be allowed lighter
ones.<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c010'><sup>[174]</sup></a> They were liable to be flogged with ropes
or whips or anything that came handy,<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c010'><sup>[175]</sup></a> the
common instrument of flagellation, however,
being the formidable <i>membrum tauri</i>.<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c010'><sup>[176]</sup></a> They
might be kept in damp dungeons and darkness;
the living were sometimes locked up with the
dead. They could be set apart and purposely
exposed to utter starvation,<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c010'><sup>[177]</sup></a> gaol fever, and
small-pox, or actually done to death by their
keepers’ violence.<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c010'><sup>[178]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The prisoners were robbed for room, squeezed
for food,<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c010'><sup>[179]</sup></a> and dealt with for drink of all kinds,
spirits, and tobacco, in which the officials did a
roaring trade.<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c010'><sup>[180]</sup></a> Lastly, the new arrivals at a
prison were fleeced and pillaged by their fellow
gaol-birds for “chummage” or “garnish” money,<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c010'><sup>[181]</sup></a>
and failing this, they were frequently stripped
of their very clothing, a process termed “letting
the black dog walk.”<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c010'><sup>[182]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>And in all these vile places there was generally
no production of anything. The prisons and
Bridewells were supposed originally to set
rogues to work,<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c010'><sup>[183]</sup></a> but the authorities took no
trouble to organise it, and throughout the
detention-places useful employment (if we except
occasional work done for the gaoler, or permitted
in particular instances) was impossible. It was
found in 1818,<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c010'><sup>[184]</sup></a> that, out of the 518 prisons in
the United Kingdom, in 445 there was no
employment, and that in the remaining 73 it
was of the slightest possible description. Such
were the bad old prisons of the past. Their
faults were many, glaring, and obvious, but they
had yet a human side, too, and a better one.
Though the idiot might be laughed at and the
new-comer despoiled, though the keepers might
be brutal and the atmosphere poisonous, still in
the midst of evil there would be individual acts
of kindness and self-sacrifice. If the captives
were in chains and rags,<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c010'><sup>[185]</sup></a> they were not cut off
from the outside world or striped and spotted in
a livery of shame.<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c010'><sup>[186]</sup></a> If gaols were hotbeds
of infection and cesspools of corruption,<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c010'><sup>[187]</sup></a>
at least they were not the ghastly whited
sepulchres which were built in the nineteenth
century.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mitigations and Peculiarities</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>So far we have endeavoured to trace the course
of the usual punishments inflicted in various ages
on the “common” criminals when they were
brought up charged with the graver crimes.
There were, however, ways of escape open, which
are sufficiently general and important to be dealt
with separately.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>The Ordeals.</i>—The invocation of miraculous
guidance, to determine the guilt or innocence of
a person accused, has been resorted to from time
immemorial by all manner of methods throughout
the four continents.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were many ordeals in mediæval England.
There was the corsned, or consecrated barleycake,
which was supposed to choke a perjurer
if he tried to swallow it; when mouth and throat
were dry from fear or excitement this was quite
possible. There was a test by immersion, in
which the accused had to sink two ells deep—over
seven feet. A rope was attached round the
body, and it is interesting to notice that Archbishop
Hincmar (ninth century) gave express
directions for the rescuing of those who, by
thus sinking, were declared to be innocent.<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c010'><sup>[188]</sup></a>
There was a test tried with hot water, in which
a stone had to be picked up out of boiling liquid
without the arm being scalded. There was a
test, to pass which the hand had to be inserted
into a glove of hot iron without being burned
by it. There was a test in which the suspected
person must walk through flames without being
scorched. There was a test which consisted in
having to walk over nine red-hot ploughshares,
blindfolded and unseared.<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c010'><sup>[189]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Perhaps, however, the best-known ordeal was
that which was worked out with a heated iron
bar or ring.<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c010'><sup>[190]</sup></a> This generally weighed three
pounds, and had to be carried—they were
always personal and picturesque in the middle
ages—for a distance of nine times the length of
the bearer’s foot.<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c010'><sup>[191]</sup></a> His hand was then bound
up and left alone for three days.<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c010'><sup>[192]</sup></a> At the end
of these it was examined, and if found clean and
free from suppuration<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c010'><sup>[193]</sup></a> the accused was acquitted.</p>

<p class='c011'>Doubtless, in deeply superstitious times the
ordeals, with their solemn prayers and incantations,
were fairly effective. But yet they do
not seem to have been altogether trusted, at any rate
in the later period,<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c010'><sup>[194]</sup></a> since even those who
passed successfully through them were obliged
to quit the country within forty days.<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c010'><sup>[195]</sup></a> Most
people, however, who underwent ordeals had
been arraigned by twelve knights of the county
(who thus resembled a Grand Jury) and were
already under grave suspicion;<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c010'><sup>[196]</sup></a> the ordeal, then,
could only say not proven. Moreover, it would
appear from various sources that the tests and
trials were frequently tampered with,<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c010'><sup>[197]</sup></a> the
elaborate ritual giving plenty of opportunity;<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c010'><sup>[198]</sup></a>
at least one king scoffed at priestly acquittals.<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c010'><sup>[199]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>After incurring the disapproval of many Popes,
the ordeals were condemned at the fourth Council
of Lateran in 1215, and by the eighteenth
canon priests were forbidden to pronounce their
blessing upon them.<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c010'><sup>[200]</sup></a> The ordeals were abolished
in England in the reign of Henry III. and the
juries took their place.<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c010'><sup>[201]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Another species of ordeal, and certainly
another means of escape from the criminal law,
was the wager of battle. This very ancient
mode of trial<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c010'><sup>[202]</sup></a> was introduced into England by
the Normans under William I. If a man made
a charge against another, and proofs of guilt
were not obvious and overwhelming, the latter
could demand trial by battle,<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c010'><sup>[203]</sup></a> unless the complainant
were over sixty years old or were sick
and infirm,<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c010'><sup>[204]</sup></a> or laboured under some physical disability,<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c010'><sup>[205]</sup></a>
in which case he might choose the ordeal.<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c010'><sup>[206]</sup></a>
Priests, infirm persons, and women might have
champions to represent them.<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c010'><sup>[207]</sup></a> The knights
fought with their usual weapons,<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c010'><sup>[208]</sup></a> the plebeians
with staves forty-five inches long, which were
tipped with iron heads shaped like rams’ horns.<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c010'><sup>[209]</sup></a>
They were to be bareheaded, barefooted, and
close-shaven; and so they fought till death or
surrender,<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c010'><sup>[210]</sup></a> at first with the clubs, and afterwards,
failing them, in hideous grapple, killing as
best they could. If the accuser were defeated
he could be committed to gaol as a calumniator,<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c010'><sup>[211]</sup></a>
but was not to lose life or limb; he was,
however, fined sixty shillings and lost civil
rights.<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c010'><sup>[212]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>If the person who was accused—were he
knight or peasant—yielded, he was then forthwith
hanged or beheaded as being guilty.<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c010'><sup>[213]</sup></a> If,
however, he prevailed in the combat or defended
himself till the stars came out,<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c010'><sup>[214]</sup></a> he might leave
the field as being acquitted,<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c010'><sup>[215]</sup></a> unless, perchance,
the justices desired to put him on trial for something
else, which they occasionally did.</p>

<p class='c011'>The custom of trial by battle, along with all
other kinds of ordeals,<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c010'><sup>[216]</sup></a> dropped out of practical
usage during the thirteenth century,<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c010'><sup>[217]</sup></a> but continued
the law for five hundred years afterwards.
In 1818 it was recalled into action.<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c010'><sup>[218]</sup></a> One
Abraham Thornton was strongly suspected of
having outraged and murdered a girl, Mary
Ashford. Although he was acquitted when tried
by a jury, he was immediately accused by her
brother and heir-at-law, and claimed to defend
by the wager of battle. The fight was refused
by the plaintiff, and shortly afterwards there was
passed “An Act to abolish Appeals of Murder,
Treason, Felony, or other Offences ... and Wager
of Battel,”<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c010'><sup>[219]</sup></a> so it could not be claimed again.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another haven of refuge from the clutches of
the State was found within the pale of <span class='sc'>Sanctuary</span>.
Although, like prayer or sacrifice,<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c010'><sup>[220]</sup></a> existing round
the globe from the beginning, we may confine
ourselves to Christian shelters, as they alone
affected our laws.</p>

<p class='c011'>The early Church doubtless afforded refuge as
soon as it possessed the power to do so, and gave
asylum from the reign of Constantine.<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c010'><sup>[221]</sup></a> Laws
were made on the right of refuge by Theodosius
in 392,<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c010'><sup>[222]</sup></a> boundaries of sanctuary were
extended by Theodosius junior in the fifth
century,<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c010'><sup>[223]</sup></a> while many kinds of offenders were
debarred from it under Justinian (483–565).<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c010'><sup>[224]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The saving power of sanctuary<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c010'><sup>[225]</sup></a> would seem
to have been but feeble and tentative in the
earlier period, since debtors to the State, Jewish
converts who were debtors, heretics and apostates,
the slaves of orthodox masters (the slaves of
heretics and heathens obtained their freedom<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c010'><sup>[226]</sup></a>),
and persons guilty of the more serious offences,
were refused privilege.<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c010'><sup>[227]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>But the protection of the mighty Roman
Church was to be something more than a mere
respite for the lesser grades of offenders. In the
year 511 a Council of Orleans<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c010'><sup>[228]</sup></a> ordered that
criminals who sought refuge in a church or house
of a bishop should not be dragged forth from it.
Even the slave given up to his master was not
to be hurt by him. About a century later Pope
Boniface V. (619–625)<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c010'><sup>[229]</sup></a> commanded that none
who had taken refuge should be abandoned.
The same spirit is found in the <i>Decretum Gratiani</i>
compiled in 1151. Pope Innocent III., in a
letter written in 1200,<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c010'><sup>[230]</sup></a> ordered that only night
robbers, bandits, and persons doing violence
within the church should be given up.<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c010'><sup>[231]</sup></a> And
this we find reaffirmed by Gregory IX. in the
year 1234.<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c010'><sup>[232]</sup></a> In 1261 Boniface, Archbishop of
Canterbury, in his Constitutions<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c010'><sup>[233]</sup></a> expressly
forbade that any obstacle should be placed in
the way of food being brought to such as were
in a sanctuary—so much had the Church increased
in power since Alfred’s time—and that any should
be molested who, having taken it, had forsworn
the country.<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c010'><sup>[234]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The exiles to whom this thirteenth-century
archbishop alludes were persons who had fled
into churches, where they could then claim
refuge for forty days.<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c010'><sup>[235]</sup></a> The buildings were
watched that no one should escape, and if a
man got away the parish was fined. At the
end of this period the refugees must surrender,<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c010'><sup>[236]</sup></a>
but they might make an oath before the coroner
admitting their guilt, and also promising to quit
the realm. A road and port of destination
were then assigned them,<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c010'><sup>[237]</sup></a> and they might travel
thither “with a wooden cross in their hands,
barefooted, ungirded, and bareheaded, in their
coats only.<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c010'><sup>[238]</sup></a> And,” said the king, “we forbid
any one under peril of life and limb to kill them
so long as they are on their road pursuing their
journey.”<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c010'><sup>[239]</sup></a> But they would forfeit goods and
chattels if they had any.<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c010'><sup>[240]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Under the masterful tyranny of Henry VIII.
it was held that too many British subjects
escaped this wise, and it was enacted in 1530<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c010'><sup>[241]</sup></a>
that those who had taken sanctuary should not
leave the realm, but should be sent to one of the
privileged places (if it were not full, which at
that time meant if it contained not more than
twenty people), there to remain as sanctuary
persons for the rest of their lives; and they
were also to be branded on the thumb.<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c010'><sup>[242]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The great sanctuaries comprised Westminster
Abbey, and at least thirty other celebrated
monasteries,<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c010'><sup>[243]</sup></a> amongst which were St. Martin-le-Grand,
Beverley, Hexham, Durham, and
Beaulieu, which possessed special charters and
immunities.<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c010'><sup>[244]</sup></a> Though traitors, Jews, infidels,
and those guilty of sacrilege were not to be
received, and though even the peace of a minster
might, in the strifes of State, be broken through
as in 1398, or evaded as in 1483, yet those
within were generally safe from all men. A
follower of Jack Cade<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c010'><sup>[245]</sup></a> was protected against
the king, and even one of the murderers<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c010'><sup>[246]</sup></a> of the
little princes in the Tower found refuge in St.
Martin’s Sanctuary.<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c010'><sup>[247]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>There were whole colonies of these fugitives
round the great abbeys already mentioned. “The
right of asylum,” says Dean Stanley,<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c010'><sup>[248]</sup></a> “rendered
the whole precinct a vast Cave of Adullam for
all the distressed and discontented in the
metropolis who desired, according to the phrase
of the time, to take Westminster.” But the
power of the State increased more and more,
and the dominion of the Church was sapped
away.<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c010'><sup>[249]</sup></a> In 1483 King Henry VII. obtained a
Bull from Innocent VIII. which allowed malefactors
to be taken from the sanctuaries if it
were proved that they had sallied out from them
to commit crimes. In 1504 he procured a Bull
allowing him to take out persons suspected of
treason. In 1534 King Henry VIII. said that
lese-majesty was treason, and deprived those
guilty of privilege.<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c010'><sup>[250]</sup></a> In 1535 sanctuary persons
were forbidden to carry weapons or to go
out between sunset and sunrise.<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c010'><sup>[251]</sup></a> In 1540
many sanctuaries were extinguished, and several
offences, such as wilful murder, rape, burglary,
and arson, were excluded from privilege.<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c010'><sup>[252]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The sanctuary at the Abbey was broken up
in 1566,<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c010'><sup>[253]</sup></a> and doubtless all the others came to
a sudden end upon the dissolution of the
monasteries. In 1604 the old rules and laws
about sanctuaries were repealed.<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c010'><sup>[254]</sup></a> In the year
1623 all rights of refuge were taken away.<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c010'><sup>[255]</sup></a>
The idea lingered in the popular imagination,
however, and in 1697 it had to be pointed out
by statute that arrests for debt could be made
in “pretended privileged places.”<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c010'><sup>[256]</sup></a> These districts
(such as the Mint, Suffolk Place, etc.) were
alluded to again in 1722,<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c010'><sup>[257]</sup></a> and likewise in 1724<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c010'><sup>[258]</sup></a>
as regards Wapping, Stepney, in Middlesex—more
than a century after legal abolition.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet another way was open to people of good
position or repute by which they could extricate
themselves from the ordinary course of law<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c010'><sup>[259]</sup></a> (but
not against the suit of the king, and there were
also other limitations), and that was by means
of formal <span class='sc'>Compurgation</span>. We have seen that
in Teutonic communities the oath of a slave had
no legal value, while the oath of a thane was
worth those of six labourers. Thus kings and
bishops might sometimes rebut accusations by
means of their word alone.<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c010'><sup>[260]</sup></a> The Visigoths
allowed an accused person (of credit) to reply
in this manner,<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c010'><sup>[261]</sup></a> but the practice was condemned
by the Church as inciting to perjury.<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c010'><sup>[262]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The usual course<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c010'><sup>[263]</sup></a> was for the accused to
obtain eleven or twelve compurgators<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c010'><sup>[264]</sup></a>—relations,
neighbours, or fellow-craftsmen who would swear
with him to the justice of his cause.<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c010'><sup>[265]</sup></a> Perjury
was indeed often suspected in these compurgations,
and if a man of bad character got his co-witnesses<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c010'><sup>[266]</sup></a>
(and if he could not he was generally
sent to the ordeal) he was frequently banished
in spite of their testimony.<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c010'><sup>[267]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>In the beginning of the thirteenth century
Pope Innocent III. modified the oath,<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c010'><sup>[268]</sup></a> and afterwards
witnesses swore only to character, to
their belief in the accused’s credibility. Compurgation
appealed especially to the clergy,<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c010'><sup>[269]</sup></a> and
was even called the <i>Purgatio Canonica</i>.<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c010'><sup>[270]</sup></a> Cut
off by their calling from all lay connections, they
could rely the more upon their own brethren.
It was by solemnly swearing with twelve priests
as compurgators that Pope Leo III. elected to
clear himself from certain accusations, in the
presence of Charlemagne (in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 800);<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c010'><sup>[271]</sup></a> and in
803 that emperor ordered priests to defend
themselves by taking an oath with three, five,
or seven compurgators. The practice began to
decline towards the close of the twelfth century,<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c010'><sup>[272]</sup></a>
but still lingered on into the sixteenth century
in England, and in isolated cases to later times.
The Wager of Law was not formally repealed
till 1833.<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c010'><sup>[273]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>The Rule of the Church</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>The Christians had always been an exclusive
body of people, at first from fear, and afterwards
from fanaticism. They excommunicated
all offending members, thus not only cutting
them off from fellowship, but also depriving
them of those rites which in their creed were
necessary for salvation. This custom of excluding
from communion was from the first a
formidable spiritual weapon among believers;
what it became when the Christians could
also wield the sword of temporal power we
shall see in the course of time. In the early
days they were a world within the world—vehement
in convictions, stimulated by persecutions,
and extremely well organised.</p>

<p class='c011'>Their bishops arbitrated and ruled in ecclesiastical
matters,<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c010'><sup>[274]</sup></a> and also in civil suits between
individuals who were unwilling to go to law
before unbelievers, and doubtless they sat in
judgment on their own followers before the
advent of the regular Ecclesiastical Courts of
subsequent ages.<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c010'><sup>[275]</sup></a> From the Apostolic times
they had resented resort to external tribunals,<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c010'><sup>[276]</sup></a>
and, in a series of Councils,<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c010'><sup>[277]</sup></a> the Church had
forbidden appeal to the civil powers against the
decisions of Christian Courts; by the eighty-seventh
Canon of the Fourth Council of Carthage
(<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 398) no Catholic was to bring any cause,
whether just or unjust, before an heretical judge.</p>

<p class='c011'>The time came when the State accepted
Christianity, and when that religion influenced
the laws.<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c010'><sup>[278]</sup></a> Under Constantine the civil officers
were obliged to carry out the decrees of the
Christian bishops, who exercised a wide jurisdiction.
In 376 their Courts were given the same
status as belonged to those of the imperial
magistrates.<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c010'><sup>[279]</sup></a> From the beginning, and under
the Theodosian and Justinian Codes, the bishops
possessed great disciplinary powers; and after
the death of Charlemagne, in the midst of a period
of violence and disruption, the Ecclesiastical
Courts were firmly established and gained in
power as the centuries went by.<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c010'><sup>[280]</sup></a> They had
their own rules and codes to determine cases,<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c010'><sup>[281]</sup></a>
and came to adjudicate upon many things which
do not concern us, such as tithes, breaches of
covenant, births, marriages, and wills.<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c010'><sup>[282]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>It used to be a custom in ancient times for
the bishop to go journeying through his diocese.
As he entered each parish he would be met by
the inhabitants, from amongst whom he would
select seven men of mature age and strait
character,<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c010'><sup>[287]</sup></a> who were then sworn on holy relics
to relate all they knew, or possibly imagined,
about their neighbours and their shortcomings.
The bishop or his archdeacon<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c010'><sup>[288]</sup></a> would then investigate
and summon suspected persons before
them for examination and sentence.<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c010'><sup>[289]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>It would appear that these inquisitions with
the <i>Testes Synodales</i> could be extremely punitive
when undertaken by a vigilant and censorious
Christian moralist. We find that an energetic
Bishop of Lincoln so harried his diocese,<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c010'><sup>[290]</sup></a> and
with amazing and minutely personal examinations<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c010'><sup>[291]</sup></a>
unearthed so many scandals among all
ranks of the people,<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c010'><sup>[292]</sup></a> that he was checked by
Henry III.<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c010'><sup>[293]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Although the nations and the laws of Europe
ceased to be pagan, and became Christianised,
the Church, with its haughty claims and well-learned
rulers, sought for autonomy. Had not
the Apostle Paul said that they should judge
angels,<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c010'><sup>[294]</sup></a> and that the saints some day should
judge, the world?<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c010'><sup>[295]</sup></a> After such a text it was
easy to claim that the Emperor Constantine had
declared at the great Council of Nicaea<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c010'><sup>[296]</sup></a> (in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>
325) that priests could be judged by God, but
not by men. The clergy wanted to be tried by
their peers, and looked askance at the other
Courts; the times were given over to violence,
the punishments were always sanguinary, and
the lay lords and judges were exceedingly
rapacious.<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c010'><sup>[297]</sup></a> If there were no more open pagans
in high places, there came along various heretics
certain to be abhorred at least equally.</p>

<p class='c011'>So the Church started on a long contention,
in which there were many struggles, with local
victories and defeats in different countries. In
the earlier period the State was the stronger;
a law of Gratian<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c010'><sup>[298]</sup></a> (fourth century) reserved to
the Secular Court all but the slight offences of
the clergy. It was laid down at the Council
of Agde in 506,<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c010'><sup>[299]</sup></a> and again at the Council of
Epaone in 517,<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c010'><sup>[300]</sup></a> that while the clergy should
not appeal to the civil power as plaintiffs,<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c010'><sup>[301]</sup></a> they
were to attend if summoned to the Secular
Courts. At a Council of Macon in 581<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c010'><sup>[302]</sup></a> it is
implied that criminal cases were to be conceded
to them. At the same time the clergy were
forbidden to accuse one another before civil
magistrates.<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c010'><sup>[303]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The fear and jealousy of the Secular Courts
persisted; by a Canon of the Third Council of
Orleans (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 538),<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c010'><sup>[304]</sup></a> the bishop’s permission was
to be given before a cleric could attend as
plaintiff or defendant. By the fourth Canon of
the Fifth Council of Paris (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 615),<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c010'><sup>[305]</sup></a> no judge
was to try any ecclesiastic without first giving
notice to his ordinary; this order is repeated in
a Capitulary of Charlemagne of <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 769. Pope
Gregory the Great (540–604)<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c010'><sup>[306]</sup></a> had contended for
the principle that a clerical defendant was entitled
to be tried by his own Court, and this was
established by Welsh Canons of the seventh
century.<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c010'><sup>[307]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>A Capitulary of Charlemagne gave the
bishops criminal jurisdiction over the clergy,<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c010'><sup>[308]</sup></a>
though the emperor reserved to himself the
right of final decision in all cases.<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c010'><sup>[309]</sup></a> By the year
853 his grandson, the superstitious Charles the
Bald, was appealing to the bishops at Soissons
against the person of a humble clerk who was
accused of forging the royal signature.<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c010'><sup>[310]</sup></a> In <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>
866<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c010'><sup>[311]</sup></a> Pope Nicholas I., in his advice to the
Bulgarians, declared that laymen had no right
to scrutinise or condemn any priests, who were
to be left to the control of their prelates. The
Council of Ravenna in 877<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c010'><sup>[312]</sup></a> ordered that none
who were under the bishops’ guardianship should
be seized by the seculars.</p>

<p class='c011'>The two systems drifted farther and farther
apart;<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c010'><sup>[313]</sup></a> clerks were forbidden under pains and
penalties to attend secular summonses. The
Emperor Frederic II.<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c010'><sup>[314]</sup></a> decreed in 1220 that no
one might drag a clerk before a secular tribunal;
any lay judge who convicted one was to forfeit his
place, besides incurring spiritual penalties.<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c010'><sup>[315]</sup></a> The
Emperor Charles IV. made similar laws in 1359
(<i>Constit. Caroli IV.</i> 5), and punished the imprisonment
of a clerk with outlawry and loss
of possessions.<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c010'><sup>[316]</sup></a> This was confirmed by Pope
Martin V. in 1418. The right to clerical immunity<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c010'><sup>[317]</sup></a>
was reasserted at the twenty-fifth session
(20) of the General Council of Trent in 1563.<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c010'><sup>[318]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The Church, as we have already seen, had
been allowed and appointed to regulate the faith
and morals of all men. It also claimed, and, in
the long-run, secured, the right to demand all
clerics accused of crimes,<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c010'><sup>[319]</sup></a> except in cases of
high treason, highway marauding,<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c010'><sup>[320]</sup></a> and deliberate
house burning,<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c010'><sup>[321]</sup></a> offences against the laws of the
forest (that is hunting the king’s deer, etc.),<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c010'><sup>[322]</sup></a>
and misdemeanours (<i>i.e.</i> slight offences).<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c010'><sup>[323]</sup></a> In
time all clerks claimed privilege of clergy, and
these consisted not only of those in priests’ orders<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c010'><sup>[324]</sup></a>
(of minor orders there were four degrees below
subdeacons<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c010'><sup>[325]</sup></a>), but of all those who were tonsured
and had their hair cut in the clerical fashion.<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c010'><sup>[326]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>All anywise connected with Church work,
such as the readers, acolytes, and door-keepers,
could claim clergy.<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c010'><sup>[327]</sup></a> So that the state of clerkship
was frequently claimed,<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c010'><sup>[328]</sup></a> both justly and
fraudulently, by extremely humble people, and
the existence of the tonsure, and also its genuineness,
were very important in criminal cases,
for it was sometimes assumed as a claim to
immunity,<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c010'><sup>[329]</sup></a> and occasionally the accused would
have their heads shaved by the prosecutors in
order to obliterate it.<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c010'><sup>[330]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>By the statute <i>Pro Clero</i> of 1350,<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c010'><sup>[331]</sup></a> “all
manner of clerks, as well secular as religious,
which shall be from henceforth convicted before
the secular justices aforesaid for any treasons or
felonies touching other persons than the King
himself or his royal majesty, shall from henceforth
freely have and enjoy the privilege of Holy
Church, and shall be, without any impeachment
or delay, delivered to the ordinaries demanding
them.” This came to mean immunity for all
who could read.<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c010'><sup>[332]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>A man who claimed clergy was examined
as to his scholarship, being required to read a
passage,<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c010'><sup>[333]</sup></a> usually from the 51st Psalm, which
was called his “neck verse.”<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c010'><sup>[334]</sup></a> Then said the lay
Court to the bishop’s representative, “Legit ut
clericus?” and the examiner replied, “Legit,”
or “Non legit”;<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c010'><sup>[335]</sup></a> and the person would either be
remitted to the ordinary or sentenced by the
judge, although it was forbidden to teach an
accused person his letters<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c010'><sup>[336]</sup></a> while he awaited trial
(and he might have to lie five or six years in the
bishop’s prison until he could be presented at the
assizes—Pollock and Maitland, <i>Hist. Eng. Law</i>,
p. 442); yet foreigners might read from books in
their own language,<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c010'><sup>[337]</sup></a> and the blind could claim
clerkship if they could speak in the Latin tongue.</p>

<p class='c011'>Clearly, to be tried by the Ecclesiastical
Courts was looked upon as being a privilege
and an advantage by the person accused.<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c010'><sup>[338]</sup></a> He
had every chance of acquitting himself<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c010'><sup>[339]</sup></a> by means
of the Canonical Purgation (see Compurgation,
<i>ante</i>);<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c010'><sup>[340]</sup></a> and even if he happened to be condemned
by bishop or abbot,<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c010'><sup>[341]</sup></a> in case he failed to obtain
the necessary compurgators, or were delivered
over <i>absque purgatione</i> (<i>i.e.</i> not allowed to
make his purgation),<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c010'><sup>[342]</sup></a> or even if, from religious
fears, he refused to swear innocence,<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c010'><sup>[343]</sup></a> the
ecclesiastical punishments were generally merciful,
except for such deadly sins as heresy or
witchcraft.</p>

<p class='c011'>The clergy were forbidden by the Canons to
impose sentences of death or mutilation;<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c010'><sup>[344]</sup></a> the
injunction was repeated by Archbishop Ecgberht.<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c010'><sup>[345]</sup></a>
“We threaten anathema,” wrote Archbishop
Richard in the year 1175,<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c010'><sup>[346]</sup></a> “to that priest who
takes the office of sheriff or reeve.” Again in
1215 were the clergy forbidden the judgment
of blood.<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c010'><sup>[347]</sup></a> They were not, said a Council of
Toledo,<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c010'><sup>[348]</sup></a> to sit as judges, even at the command
of a ruler, in cases of treason, unless he first
promised to remit the red penalties. At the
Council of Auxerre<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c010'><sup>[349]</sup></a> the clergy were prohibited
from witnessing the usual torturing, of the
prisoners, or from lingering round the trepalium
when it was in progress. In fact, except for
acts or thoughts which it considered to be high
crimes against the soul, the Church was milder
than the mediæval State.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Church being debarred from the employment
of the swift and sanguinary penalties of
those times, had to resort to other methods of disapproval,
and it evolved the penitential discipline.
At first it wielded only spiritual weapons—none
the less terrible in those days because they
were ghostly—and by refusing access to Church
or Communion, and thereby (as all concerned
fully believed) closing on kings the everlasting
doors, it sometimes brought the mightiest to
their knees to implore pardon from the priests of
God.<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c010'><sup>[350]</sup></a> On confessing a crime, or upon being
condemned, all manner of tasks and toils were
laid upon the penitent. Sometimes they were
capricious and poetic; thus if a man had slain
his near kindred,<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c010'><sup>[351]</sup></a> the weapon with which the
deed was committed could then be forged into
a penal chain, and, bound therewith, arrayed in
the sclavinia,<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c010'><sup>[352]</sup></a> or, it might be, naked, he would
have to trudge away, staff in hand, to his
destination, which might be some local shrine, or
that of St. Thomas of Canterbury; but which
might be far off, across and beyond the seas, to
Compostela, Rome, or Palestine.<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c010'><sup>[353]</sup></a> The ordinary
penitent wore no chains, but he was usually
required to go unarmed, to eat no flesh, to take
no strong drink, and to abstain from warm baths,
and sometimes he had to fulfil weird and painful
conditions particularly imposed by his penitentiary;<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c010'><sup>[354]</sup></a>
as, for instance, when Robert, called
the Devil, was ordered by a certain hermit<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c010'><sup>[355]</sup></a> to
eat only bones and scraps which had been thrown
to dogs, and to be dumb and act like one insane.
Our own King Edgar<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c010'><sup>[356]</sup></a> was condemned not to
wear his crown for seven years. Examples could
be multiplied indefinitely. A much-employed
form of correction consisted in imposing penitential
fasts,<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c010'><sup>[357]</sup></a> during which the offender was to
subsist upon bread and water,<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c010'><sup>[358]</sup></a> and was subject
to many disabilities and restrictions.<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c010'><sup>[359]</sup></a> These
sentences might be for any period ranging from a
single day to twenty years, and even longer, and
all the while the penitent was supposed to drag
out his existence in shame and disgrace, making
prayers for deliverance.<a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c010'><sup>[360]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The Church allowed class distinctions in
several ways;<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c010'><sup>[361]</sup></a> offences might be punished
according to the rank of the aggrieved party,
so that the penance for the murder of a bishop
was for twelve or fourteen years, or longer,
upon bread and water, while the slaying of a
deacon could be atoned for by seven or ten
years’, and of a layman by four, five, or seven
years’ discipline.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the other hand, people, and especially the
clergy, were liable to be sentenced more severely
in proportion to their rank.<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c010'><sup>[362]</sup></a> Thus for homicide,
where a layman would get four or five years’
penance from the ordinary,<a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c010'><sup>[363]</sup></a> a clerk would
receive six years, a priest ten, and a bishop as
much as twelve years (seven on bread and
water).<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c010'><sup>[364]</sup></a> These long-enduring penances sound
severe, and doubtless were for devout believers.
But the Roman Church, always a marvel of
organisation, allowed its bishops very great latitude,
both in imposing and removing penances.
“I require not the continuance of time,” said
Chrysostom, “but the correction of the soul;
demonstrate your contrition, demonstrate your
reformation, and all is done.” By the authority
of the Councils<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c010'><sup>[365]</sup></a> they could increase or
mitigate sentences,<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c010'><sup>[366]</sup></a> so that the infirm and
the over-sensitive might have their tasks
modified.<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c010'><sup>[367]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>But they dealt gently with the men of
might;<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c010'><sup>[368]</sup></a> the wind was tempered to the woolly
lamb.<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c010'><sup>[369]</sup></a> In spite of Cuthbert’s Canons at Cloves-Hoo
in the eighth century,<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c010'><sup>[370]</sup></a> the rich were
generally enabled to perform their pilgrimages
vicariously (whereby there had arisen a class of
professional pilgrims; Thrupp, p. 239, etc.), and
to atone for sins by almsgiving and payment.<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c010'><sup>[371]</sup></a>
“Thou hast money, buy off thy sin,” Ambrose
had written in the fourth century.<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c010'><sup>[372]</sup></a> “The Lord
is not for sale, but thou thyself art for sale.
Restore thee by thy works. Buy thyself back
by thy money.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This exhortation was followed and given the
lowest possible interpretation in the Canons
made (by Dunstan, probably) in the reign of
King Edgar in the year 963.<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c010'><sup>[373]</sup></a> When a great
man had been condemned to fast, say seven
years, he was to lay aside his weapons, and take
his staff in his hand and walk barefoot, clad in
wool or haircloth, and he was not to go to bed
or banquet for three days.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was to take to his assistance twelve men,
and they were to fast three days on bread, raw
herbs, and water: thus thirty-six fasts were
kept. He was to get together seven times 120
men and set them to fast three days; thus
he secured 7 × 120 × 3 + 36 fasts, or 2556,
which meant as many fasts as there were
days in seven years, counting a leap year!
And thus his penance was done, or rather
evaded.<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c010'><sup>[374]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>But the Church did not usually allow its
penalties to be disregarded; against heretics
there were, even in England, severe statutes,<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c010'><sup>[375]</sup></a>
and they would be seized by the civil forces and
burned alive. Any one who had offended against
the Canons, and who refused to do penance,
could be excommunicated, and then he became
liable to arrest.<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c010'><sup>[376]</sup></a> In this country if the offender
ignored it for forty days,<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c010'><sup>[377]</sup></a> the King’s Court, on
the request of the bishop,<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c010'><sup>[378]</sup></a> issued a Writ of
Significavit,<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c010'><sup>[379]</sup></a> or some similar injunction, ordering
the sheriff to imprison him until he had satisfied
the claims of the Church.<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c010'><sup>[380]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The hierarchy, although, as we have seen,
debarred from directly inflicting such penalties
as death or amputation of members, resorted to
many forms of corporal punishment. Floggings
for penance or discipline were administered frequently;<a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c010'><sup>[381]</sup></a>
the younger monks in the monasteries
commonly received thirty-nine stripes.<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c010'><sup>[382]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>But the bishops had other and worse penalties
in reserve, and, unlike the secular rulers, they
employed imprisonment as a means of punishment
in itself. The Catholic Church, with its ideals
of cloistral life and ascetic seclusion, sought to
produce remorse through mental affliction, and
in its high-walled abbeys and gloomy courts had
buildings ready to immure any one. The first
cells were among the <i>exedrae</i> round churches and
bishops’ houses and were called the <i>decanica</i>,<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c010'><sup>[383]</sup></a>
while refractory monks were freely imprisoned in
the great monasteries.<a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c010'><sup>[384]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Though the ecclesiastical punishments<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c010'><sup>[385]</sup></a> were
accounted generally merciful—as we shall see
presently from English comments on them—they
could be pitiless enough on occasions,
especially against heretics. The secret and
dreadful Inquisition had its own prisons,<a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c010'><sup>[386]</sup></a> in
which it tortured its victims by every means that
subtlety could suggest, and in which the mind-wrecking
results of solitary confinement were
probably first discovered, and at any rate
utilised.</p>

<p class='c011'>Already back in the thirteenth century the
authorities had frowned on prison association.<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c010'><sup>[387]</sup></a>
In 1229 a Council of Toulouse ordered that the
“converted” heretics (<i>i.e.</i> those who had recanted
from the fear of execution, and who were
even then sentenced to imprisonment for life;
<i>vide</i> Lea, on Laws of Frederic II., Bull of
Gregory IX., etc., in his <i>Middle Ages</i>, i. pp. 321,
484) should be kept from corrupting others.
The new prisons built for the Church and the
Inquisition<a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c010'><sup>[388]</sup></a> were ordered to have small dark
dungeons for solitary confinement. In 1246 a
Council of Beziers<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c010'><sup>[389]</sup></a> ordered that the captives
should be kept separate in secret cells, so that
no one might corrupt another. It speaks of
the “enormis rigor carceris.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The prisoners of the Church<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c010'><sup>[390]</sup></a> were subjected to
various kinds of incarceration. There was the
<i>Murus Largus</i>, under which they were allowed
about the place;<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c010'><sup>[391]</sup></a> the <i>Murus Strictus</i>, <i>Durus</i>,
or <i>Arctus</i>, by which they were supposed to be
confined in separate cells upon bread and water;<a id='r392' /><a href='#f392' class='c010'><sup>[392]</sup></a>
and the <i>Murus Strictissimus</i>, where they were
kept in dungeons and in heavy irons.<a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c010'><sup>[393]</sup></a> The
Inquisition employed, besides, innumerable torments,
and could learn little from the imaginings
of Dante; but that dread organisation has a
history of its own.</p>

<p class='c011'>Apart from it, the bishops<a id='r394' /><a href='#f394' class='c010'><sup>[394]</sup></a> possessed their
prisons, and the great convents had penal cells,<a id='r395' /><a href='#f395' class='c010'><sup>[395]</sup></a>
and these they would use to inflict penance or
punishment.<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c010'><sup>[396]</sup></a> Thus at Canossa, in 1077, Pope
Gregory VII.<a id='r397' /><a href='#f397' class='c010'><sup>[397]</sup></a> consigned the rebellious German
prelates to solitary cells with bread and water
dietary.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again we may read of another example
occurring in the year 1283. A certain Brother
John had, it appears, bitten his prior’s finger
“like a dog,” it was said; and for this we find
the bishop ordering the outraged prior<a id='r398' /><a href='#f398' class='c010'><sup>[398]</sup></a> “to keep
the said Brother John in prison under iron chains,
in which he shall be content with bread, indifferent
ale, pottage, and a pittance of meat
or fish (which on the sixth day he shall do
without) until he is penitent.” A worse fate
befell Alexander de Langley in the same
century.<a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c010'><sup>[399]</sup></a> This unfortunate creature was a man
of great culture and was the keeper of the abbot’s
seal. Either from approaching general paralysis,
or from some other form of insanity, he passed
into a state of extreme exaltation, perhaps to
the extent of being, as they would take it,
mutinous or blasphemous. A severe flogging
having failed to restore his sense of proportion,
he was consigned in fetters to a cell in which he
ultimately died, and was buried, the corpse still
chained.</p>

<p class='c011'>There had also existed within the monasteries
the dreadful punishment of solitary confinement
known as <i>In Pace</i>. “Those subjected to it,” says
Dr. Lea,<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c010'><sup>[400]</sup></a> “died in all the agonies of despair. In
1350 the Archbishop of Toulouse appealed to
King John to interfere for its mitigation, and he
issued an ordinance that the superior of the
convent should, twice a month, visit and console
the prisoners, who, moreover, should have the
right, twice a month, to ask for the company of
one of the monks. Even this slender innovation
incurred the bitterest resistance of the
Dominicans and Franciscans, who appealed to
Pope Clement VI., but in vain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There could indeed be abuses and cruelties in
ecclesiastical prisons, as there always are where
high walls conceal. For instance, we may read<a id='r401' /><a href='#f401' class='c010'><sup>[401]</sup></a>
that in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1283 certain monks were seized by
the Abbot of Westminster, “and so greatly
beaten that one of them has miserably expired.”
There were cases where the Church took the
extreme step of degrading from orders. In the
very early period this often meant that degraded
clerics would be immediately claimed by the
secular authorities and set servile tasks<a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c010'><sup>[402]</sup></a>—after
which they could not be reinstated. Very often
they were shut up in the monasteries,<a id='r403' /><a href='#f403' class='c010'><sup>[403]</sup></a> a course
which the bishops preferred to remitting them
to lay punishment.<a id='r404' /><a href='#f404' class='c010'><sup>[404]</sup></a> Innocent III. (1198–1216),
however, directed that clergy who had been
degraded should then be handed over to the
secular powers.<a id='r405' /><a href='#f405' class='c010'><sup>[405]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>But in actual practice clerks were not often
totally degraded.<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c010'><sup>[406]</sup></a> To be deprived of orders was
looked upon as a terrible punishment;<a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c010'><sup>[407]</sup></a> it was
the final casting from the fold and was inflicted
with great difficulty.<a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c010'><sup>[408]</sup></a> Three bishops were
required to degrade even a deacon; six were
necessary to unfrock a priest; and it took twelve
prelates to adjudicate upon a bishop.<a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c010'><sup>[409]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>When any were degraded, excommunicated,
and sent to the seculars, the sanguinary lay
penalties took their course.<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c010'><sup>[410]</sup></a> The chief offence
for which the Church withdrew all protection
was obstinate or repeated heresy. In the earlier
period those found guilty were branded on the
forehead<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c010'><sup>[411]</sup></a> and cast out<a id='r412' /><a href='#f412' class='c010'><sup>[412]</sup></a> (as once from Oxford,
to die of cold and starvation) excommunicate, or
they might be imprisoned and have their property
confiscated.<a id='r413' /><a href='#f413' class='c010'><sup>[413]</sup></a> But with the rise and multiplication
of militant sectaries, the Church urged the State
to proceed to extremities.</p>

<p class='c011'>Heretics were ruthlessly burned alive by
popular custom<a id='r414' /><a href='#f414' class='c010'><sup>[414]</sup></a> (and were sometimes “lynched”
like negro criminals in the United States; <i>vide</i>
Lea, <i>Middle Ages</i>, i. pp. 219, 222, 308), and
in time this became formally recognised.<a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c010'><sup>[415]</sup></a> Pedro
of Aragon in 1197, the Emperor Frederic II.
by the <i>Edict of Cremona</i> in 1238, Louis IX.
of France by his <i>Établissements</i> in 1270, and
Henry IV.<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c010'><sup>[416]</sup></a> of England in 1400, made burning at
the stake the legitimate punishment of persistent
or relapsed heretics.<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c010'><sup>[417]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>But it was not the severities of the Church
that kept arousing the jealousy and opposition
of the secular power. It was the immunity it
afforded to those under its protection<a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c010'><sup>[419]</sup></a> which
moved the State to attack clerical privileges,
and, in the course of ages, to remove them
entirely. In Saxon times lay and episcopal
authorities acted closely together, but William
of Normandy, doubtless continuing the Continental
movement already alluded to, separated
the ecclesiastical from the secular courts.</p>

<p class='c011'>King Henry II. had succeeded to the throne
after a period of civil war and devastating
brigandage, in which the Church had fortified
its position and extended its jurisdiction,<a id='r420' /><a href='#f420' class='c010'><sup>[420]</sup></a> and
was bent upon reasserting the power of the
central government. He found that the clergy
and the clerks<a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c010'><sup>[421]</sup></a> were outside his control, and in
the middle ages they were a numerous body,<a id='r422' /><a href='#f422' class='c010'><sup>[422]</sup></a> as
many people were received into orders who had
little or nothing to do in their own profession,
and who were debarred by rule from obtaining a
livelihood otherwise.<a id='r423' /><a href='#f423' class='c010'><sup>[423]</sup></a> So the king employed all
his efforts to place the clerks under his justices.</p>

<p class='c011'>A crucial case arose in 1163. A certain Philip
de Broi or de Brois,<a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c010'><sup>[424]</sup></a> who was probably an Archdeacon
of Bedford and a Canon of Lincoln, had
previously escaped personal punishment on a
charge of manslaughter, but was afterwards denounced
as a murderer by Simon FitzPeter, who
was one of the king’s justices. On this he protested
vehemently and abused the judge. There
had been several other cases about that time,
including a bad one of murder and rape by a
cleric from Worcester,<a id='r425' /><a href='#f425' class='c010'><sup>[425]</sup></a> and another of homicide
out of Salisbury,<a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c010'><sup>[426]</sup></a> in which the offender escaped
with imprisonment, and King Henry took action
with great fury.<a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c010'><sup>[427]</sup></a> He claimed to have been insulted
in the person of his delegate, and ordered
that de Broi should be brought to trial, not only
for this, but for the original manslaughter; he
wished, in fact, to send him to the gallows.
But the archbishop refused to reopen the matter
already tried and decided, but for having insulted
the king’s officer the rebellious priest was
severely dealt with,<a id='r428' /><a href='#f428' class='c010'><sup>[428]</sup></a> as he was stripped and
flogged before the angry judge, and lost his
office and stipend on being banished for two
years.<a id='r429' /><a href='#f429' class='c010'><sup>[429]</sup></a> The king was dissatisfied, desiring
nothing less than the death of the canon, and
vigorously proceeded towards the subjugation of
the clergy.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1164 he promulgated the <i>Constitutions of
Clarendon</i>, by which he desired that criminous
clerks should incur the lay penalties. The
offender was first to be accused in the temporal
court;<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c010'><sup>[430]</sup></a> then tried, convicted, and degraded by
the ecclesiastical tribunal; thence sent back for
sentence to the secular court, to receive the
customary draconic punishments. But Archbishop
Becket and the English hierarchy declared
that to degrade a clerk and then remit him to
the secular judges was to punish him twice for
the same offence.<a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c010'><sup>[431]</sup></a> “Affliction,” they said, quoting
a Hebrew prophet,<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c010'><sup>[432]</sup></a> “shall not rise up a
second time.” All they would concede was that
if a clerk after being degraded<a id='r433' /><a href='#f433' class='c010'><sup>[433]</sup></a> committed the
offence again he might be handed over as an
ordinary layman.<a id='r434' /><a href='#f434' class='c010'><sup>[434]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The death of Archbishop Thomas stayed all
Henry’s plans as regards the Church. “The
temporal courts maintained their claim to bring
the criminous clerk before them; they abandoned
their claim to punish the degraded clerk.”<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c010'><sup>[435]</sup></a> In
the thirteenth century it had become the custom
that the clerk<a id='r436' /><a href='#f436' class='c010'><sup>[436]</sup></a> should first be indicted and inquired
upon before he could claim his clergy;<a id='r437' /><a href='#f437' class='c010'><sup>[437]</sup></a> by
the reign of Henry VI.—1422–1461—he must
first be convicted<a id='r438' /><a href='#f438' class='c010'><sup>[438]</sup></a> before being passed into the
hands of his bishop.<a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c010'><sup>[439]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>In 1261 Archbishop Boniface<a id='r440' /><a href='#f440' class='c010'><sup>[440]</sup></a> ordered that
the clerks in their bishops’ custody for capital
crimes should suffer perpetual imprisonment.
In 1275 Edward I. expressly ordered that
the bishops were to allow no clerks to depart
without purgation.<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c010'><sup>[441]</sup></a> In 1276,<a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c010'><sup>[442]</sup></a> the <i>Bigami</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
the persons who had been twice married or those
who had married widows<a id='r443' /><a href='#f443' class='c010'><sup>[443]</sup></a> (highly respectable
acts at the present time), were excluded from
claiming clergy.<a id='r444' /><a href='#f444' class='c010'><sup>[444]</sup></a> In 1279 Archbishop Peckham
decreed in his <i>Constitutions</i>:<a id='r445' /><a href='#f445' class='c010'><sup>[445]</sup></a> “Let not clerks
that are in prison for their crimes, and afterwards
delivered to the Church as convicts, be easily
enlarged, or admitted to purgation upon too
slight pretence, but with all solemnity of law
and with such provident deliberation that it
may not offend against the king’s majesty or any
that have a regard to equity.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1350 there came the statute <i>Pro Clero</i>.<a id='r446' /><a href='#f446' class='c010'><sup>[446]</sup></a>
Many persons had, it appears, been seized by the
seculars. By this Act the Church’s privileges were
reaffirmed,<a id='r447' /><a href='#f447' class='c010'><sup>[447]</sup></a> and the offending clerks were ordered
to be handed over to the spiritual courts. But
for this grant the king demanded that the
clerical convicts should thenceforth be safely
kept and duly punished, “so that no clerk shall
take courage to offend for default of correction.”
Thus urged by the Crown, and perhaps fearful of
other enactments, Simon Islip, Archbishop of
Canterbury, endeavoured to make things harder
for the Church’s prisoners. “They are,” he
complains, “with so much backwardness and
favour committed to gaol, and are so deliciously
fed there, that the prison intended for a punishment
for their crimes is turned into a refreshment
and delicious solace, and they are pampered
in their vices by ease and such inducements
and yet make their escape out of custody as
injurious to them.... And some notoriously
infamous criminals, that are in truth wholly
without excuse, are yet so easily admitted to
their purgations, that every clerk thus delivered
(by the secular judge) hath sure hopes of returning
to his former evil life by one means or other....
Therefore we have thought fit thus to
ordain concerning the imprisoned clerks<a id='r448' /><a href='#f448' class='c010'><sup>[448]</sup></a> ...
(they are) to be closely imprisoned with all
proper care and expedition according to the
quality of their persons and the heinousness of
their crimes, that they may not to the scandal
of the Church return to their former way of life
from an imprisonment intended for a punishment.”
Clerks guilty of bad offences are, on
Wednesday, Friday, and Sabbath day, to have
bread and water; on the other days, bread and
small beer; “but on the Lord’s day, bread, beer,
and pulse, for the honour and eminence of that
day. And let nothing else be given them by
way of alms or gratuity from their acquaintance
and friends, or for any pretence or reason whatsoever;
nor let any purgation be granted them.”
These severe rules, which, coming from the
archbishop,<a id='r449' /><a href='#f449' class='c010'><sup>[449]</sup></a> were, of course, repeated by all the
prelates, resembled the penal systems of discipline
which reached their maximum of cruelty in the
nineteenth century.</p>

<p class='c011'>But there seems good reason to believe that
the Church’s treatment of its prisoners remained,
on the whole, mild and humane. The clergy
were not hardened prison officials; their calling
was spiritual rather than military. They were
dealing with men belonging more or less to their
own order, and were prone to class loyalty.<a id='r450' /><a href='#f450' class='c010'><sup>[450]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>In the light of subsequent criticism and
legislation,<a id='r451' /><a href='#f451' class='c010'><sup>[451]</sup></a> it seems that even after Islip’s
ordinance the Church’s convicts were much
better treated than were the laymen in the
common gaols. Moreover, either (or both) from a
sense of humanity,<a id='r452' /><a href='#f452' class='c010'><sup>[452]</sup></a> or because the bishops disliked
having to pay for the keep of their prisoners,<a id='r453' /><a href='#f453' class='c010'><sup>[453]</sup></a>
long sentences were avoided and life sentences
were inflicted as rarely as possible; the prisoners
would be pardoned<a id='r454' /><a href='#f454' class='c010'><sup>[454]</sup></a> on jubilees and special
occasions, and sometimes released on their friends
paying ransom (apparently of such sums as £20
or £40; <i>vide</i> Lea, <i>Studies in Church History</i>, p.
202, and the statute 23 Hen. VIII. c. 1). The
State all along appeared on the side of severity,
and, from the thirteenth century, was in the habit
of sending clerks to their bishop <i>absque purgatione</i>,
who, in theory at least, were to be life
prisoners. Indeed, if the ordinary should attempt
to release such persons, he could be restrained
from doing so by a writ out of the Chancery.<a id='r455' /><a href='#f455' class='c010'><sup>[455]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>So early as 1238 a Bishop of Exeter<a id='r456' /><a href='#f456' class='c010'><sup>[456]</sup></a> was in
trouble for having sent a certain clerk to purgation.
Later on an Abbot of St. Albans<a id='r457' /><a href='#f457' class='c010'><sup>[457]</sup></a> was
accused of allowing some prisoners to escape;
and there are doubtless other instances. But
evidently the prisoners of the bishops were
continually being released, for we find a special
statute<a id='r458' /><a href='#f458' class='c010'><sup>[458]</sup></a> passed in the year 1402 forbidding that
clerks found guilty of treason (of less degree
than plotting against the king himself), or who
were known to be common thieves, should be
allowed any sort of purgation. In 1485 an Act<a id='r459' /><a href='#f459' class='c010'><sup>[459]</sup></a>
was passed by which the bishops might commit
priests, clerks, and religious men to ward and
prison for advowtry (<i>i.e.</i> adultery), fornication,
incest, or any other fleshly incontinence, and
they were not to be liable for actions for wrongful
imprisonment.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1487 a severe blow was aimed at immunity.
By this Act,<a id='r460' /><a href='#f460' class='c010'><sup>[460]</sup></a> clerks (<i>i.e.</i> such as could
read, but who were not actually within orders)
were to enjoy their privilege only once; and to
ensure that they should no longer be “continually
admitted as oft as they did offend,” it was
ordained that clerks not within orders, who
should hereafter be convicted of murder, should
be forthwith branded<a id='r461' /><a href='#f461' class='c010'><sup>[461]</sup></a> by the gaoler in open
court with the letter M upon the brawn of the
left thumb, and, if found guilty of theft,<a id='r462' /><a href='#f462' class='c010'><sup>[462]</sup></a> with
the letter T, before being handed over to the
ordinary’s officer.</p>

<p class='c011'>An ordained priest could appeal to his Church
again, but if he should claim his clergy a second
(or other) time, he was to have his letters of
ordination ready at hand, though he might be
allowed one day’s grace in which to obtain them—or
equivalent evidence from the nearest bishop—and
if they were not forthcoming he forfeited
all clerical privileges.<a id='r463' /><a href='#f463' class='c010'><sup>[463]</sup></a> In 1496 lay persons who
should murder their lord, master, or sovereign
immediate were deprived of their clergy; and in
the fourth year of the following reign more
exceptions were made, and clergy was taken from
all, not actually within orders, who committed a
felony in a church, or upon the king’s highway,
or who slew anybody in his own house.<a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c010'><sup>[464]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>We have already seen with what exceeding
difficulty a clerk, and more especially a priest,
could be degraded and cast out of orders. To
remedy this. Cardinal Wolsey, Archbishop of
York, obtained a Bull<a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c010'><sup>[465]</sup></a> (as regarded England)
from Pope Clement VII. in 1528, by which a
single bishop, assisted by two abbots or other
high dignitaries, could perform the ceremony.<a id='r466' /><a href='#f466' class='c010'><sup>[466]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The statute 23 Hen. VIII. c. 1 (1531) alludes
to the monition of Edward I. (1275), to the effect
that no Church prisoners should depart without
strict purgation, on which Henry VIII. observes
that, nevertheless, they were released very easily.
It cites the statute of Henry IV. (1402), which
ordered that notorious criminals should make no
purgation, and goes on to say that the ordinaries
kept releasing offenders speedily and hastily
“for corruption and lucre,” or because the clergy
will in no wise consent to take charge of prisoners.
The law then proceeds to take away the benefit of
clergy from the various petit treasons previously
referred to, and also for arson, from all clerks—subdeacons
and the grades above them still
excepted. The clergy within orders were to
have lifelong imprisonment for these crimes,</p>

<p class='c011'>By the fourth Canon at the thirteenth session of the Council
of Trent in 1551, it was decreed that a bishop or his vicar-general
could condemn, and even degrade criminous clergy,
with the assistance of as many mitred abbots, or, in default of
them, as many high ecclesiastics as there would have been
bishops under the old system. Lecourayer, i. p. 550; Luzio,
<i>Cath. Ency.</i> iv. p. 678.]
unless they could find guarantees for good
conduct—the accused to the extent of £40, with
two substantial sureties in £20 apiece. By this
statute it was also intended to relieve the bishops
of the burden of maintaining their prisoners, and
they were empowered to degrade such offending
clerks, and to hand them over “in sure and safe
keeping into the King’s Bench,” with a certificate
certifying their degradation—now so much easier—upon
which the king’s judges were to pass
such sentences (usually of death) as would have
been passed upon the convicted if, at the time
of their accusation, they had been laymen and
not clerks of any kind.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nor was this all, for in the same year (1531)
an Act<a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c010'><sup>[467]</sup></a> was passed by which escapes from the
bishop’s prison were made felony for the clerks;
those within orders were to be sent back to their
prison, to abide there without release. In
1533<a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c010'><sup>[468]</sup></a> clergy was taken away from all who
refused to plead, or who challenged above twenty
jurymen peremptorily. In 1536<a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c010'><sup>[469]</sup></a> clergymen
within orders were to be placed on the same
footing with other clerks, but this law only lasted
about a decade. But now the immunity of the
clergy began to be taken away by a long series
of statutes exempting particular crimes from any
indulgence.<a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c010'><sup>[470]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>In 1576 convicted clerks ceased to be handed
over to the bishops to make purgation.<a id='r471' /><a href='#f471' class='c010'><sup>[471]</sup></a> For
all “clergyable” felonies, Lords of Parliament<a id='r472' /><a href='#f472' class='c010'><sup>[472]</sup></a>
(even when they could not read) and the clergy
in orders were immediately released. The rest
who could read were discharged for a first offence
upon being branded, but the Court might also
order their detention in prison for not more than
a year; the captives who could not read were
speedily hanged.<a id='r473' /><a href='#f473' class='c010'><sup>[473]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>As the privilege of clergy became less worth
having it was extended: to the <i>bigami</i>, or
twice married, in 1547, and to women<a id='r474' /><a href='#f474' class='c010'><sup>[474]</sup></a> (professed
nuns had always lived under the Church’s rule)
in 1692. Upon conviction they were to be
treated in the same way as the men in similar
cases, that is, branded upon the hand, and then
discharged, either at once or after imprisonment
not exceeding one year.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1699<a id='r475' /><a href='#f475' class='c010'><sup>[475]</sup></a> it was ordered that the branding
should be done upon the face, but this cruel
marking was found to prevent the victims from
obtaining employment and to render them
desperate, and the law was repealed six years
afterwards in the reign of Anne.<a id='r476' /><a href='#f476' class='c010'><sup>[476]</sup></a> In 1705 the
reading test was abandoned. The distinction
had come to lie between offences, not offenders,<a id='r477' /><a href='#f477' class='c010'><sup>[477]</sup></a>
and all were admitted to “clergy” who had been
convicted of any of these minor felonies which
still remained clergyable.<a id='r478' /><a href='#f478' class='c010'><sup>[478]</sup></a> The Act of 1705 also
provided that such convicts should be liable to
be sent to houses of correction or to public work-houses,
for periods of not less than six months
or exceeding two years, at the discretion of the
magistrates.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1717<a id='r479' /><a href='#f479' class='c010'><sup>[479]</sup></a> it was enacted that persons (other
than peers or clerks in orders) guilty of clergyable
offences might be transported for seven
years<a id='r480' /><a href='#f480' class='c010'><sup>[480]</sup></a> (the usual sentence was for fourteen),
instead of being branded or whipped.<a id='r481' /><a href='#f481' class='c010'><sup>[481]</sup></a> In
1779<a id='r482' /><a href='#f482' class='c010'><sup>[482]</sup></a> persons liable to be burned in the hand
might escape with a fine, or they might be
whipped in public or private, not more than
three times; women were to be flogged in the
presence of females. By this Act the branding
was abolished in practice; and about half a
century later all that remained of the old
privilege was done away with in the reign of
George IV.<a id='r483' /><a href='#f483' class='c010'><sup>[483]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>It has been customary to condemn all these
old rights for so many years accorded to clerkship,
because they are supposed to have constituted
infringements of the principle that all
men should be equal before the law.<a id='r484' /><a href='#f484' class='c010'><sup>[484]</sup></a> But when
we consider the barbarities they prevented, and
after we have examined and ascertained the
aimlessness and inutility of mere punishments,
we may be forced to think that they were not
an unmixed evil, and that, perhaps, they rather
made for good.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Summary and “Poetic” Punishments</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>Since the poor human body has always been
sensitive, so at the promptings of the revenge
instinct it has always been assailable and most
readily beaten. Naturally enough the Duke of
Gloster exclaims—in that most subtle second act
of <i>Henry VI.</i>—“Have you not beadles in your
town and things called whips?” Of course they
had. The serf, the varlet, the vagabond, the
lunatic, and the petty offender were all whipped
with uncertain severity;<a id='r485' /><a href='#f485' class='c010'><sup>[485]</sup></a> most likely until the
victim was bloody and until the operator was
tired and felt he had earned his fee. Doubtless
the whips were of all sorts and sizes. They are
frequently represented as having three thongs;<a id='r486' /><a href='#f486' class='c010'><sup>[486]</sup></a>
Titus Oates was flogged with a whip of six.<a id='r487' /><a href='#f487' class='c010'><sup>[487]</sup></a> I
have seen and handled a lash of transportation
times, which had a thick leather thong bound
with wire.<a id='r488' /><a href='#f488' class='c010'><sup>[488]</sup></a> The cat-o’-nine-tails is alluded to
in the eighteenth century.<a id='r489' /><a href='#f489' class='c010'><sup>[489]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Both men and women<a id='r490' /><a href='#f490' class='c010'><sup>[490]</sup></a> (the latter up to
1817<a id='r491' /><a href='#f491' class='c010'><sup>[491]</sup></a>) were flagellated in public, being either
tied up to a post, or fastened behind a cart and
so thrashed along the road. Perhaps the most
obvious thing to do, next to flogging an offender,
was to exhibit him to the populace. The
country was immeasurably more parochial than
it is now in these times of travel, and to be
rendered infamous in one’s village or neighbourhood
was no trifling penalty; and so we find the
stocks set up in the towns and hamlets,<a id='r492' /><a href='#f492' class='c010'><sup>[492]</sup></a>
and, for more serious misdemeanours, there
was the lofty pillory or neck-catcher (the <i>heals-fang</i>).</p>

<p class='c011'>This well-known instrument<a id='r493' /><a href='#f493' class='c010'><sup>[493]</sup></a> was made of all
shapes and sizes, and varied from a forked post
or a slit pillar<a id='r494' /><a href='#f494' class='c010'><sup>[494]</sup></a> to what must have looked like a
penal dovecote made to hold several prisoners.<a id='r495' /><a href='#f495' class='c010'><sup>[495]</sup></a>
The convicted were sometimes drawn thither
on hurdles, and might be accompanied by
minstrels on the way.<a id='r496' /><a href='#f496' class='c010'><sup>[496]</sup></a> The hair of the head
and beard was shaved off, and sometimes the
victims were secured by being nailed through
the ears to the framework, and might also be
branded.<a id='r497' /><a href='#f497' class='c010'><sup>[497]</sup></a> With faces protruding through the
strong beams, and with hands through two
holes, secured and helpless, they were made
to stand defenceless before the crowd as
targets for any missiles that might be thrown.
To those who were hated this was a serious
ordeal, for they would be so pelted and
knocked about by the mob as to be badly
wounded, if not actually done to death. At
length those who had stood their time were
released, and those who had had their ears
nailed would be cut free, and then they might
slink away from the scene of shame, or be carried
back to prison to endure additional punishment.
The pillory was abolished for all offences except
perjury and subornation in 1816,<a id='r498' /><a href='#f498' class='c010'><sup>[498]</sup></a> and altogether
in the year 1837.<a id='r499' /><a href='#f499' class='c010'><sup>[499]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Before leaving the middle ages we must
examine what I have classed as the poetic
punishments. These were the spontaneous
reprisals with which the community strove
to repay the criminals in kind, and by which, if
strict taliation were seldom attainable, our
ancestors succeeded in contriving many chastisements
that were, at any rate, associable equivalents.
Of these a few examples may be given.
For instance, a baker who sold loaves which
were short of weight was shown with the bread
tied round his neck.<a id='r500' /><a href='#f500' class='c010'><sup>[500]</sup></a> A fishmonger who had
been selling bad fish was paraded with a collar
of stinking smelts slung over his shoulders.<a id='r501' /><a href='#f501' class='c010'><sup>[501]</sup></a> A
grocer who had been selling much-adulterated
spices was placed in the pillory and had the
powders burned beneath his nose (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1395).<a id='r502' /><a href='#f502' class='c010'><sup>[502]</sup></a>
A heretic who had advocated strict Judaism was
sentenced to prison and to be fed entirely upon
pork.<a id='r503' /><a href='#f503' class='c010'><sup>[503]</sup></a> The Inquisition attached two pieces of
red cloth in the shape of tongues to the breast,
and two more upon the shoulders of a false
witness, which were to be worn for life.<a id='r504' /><a href='#f504' class='c010'><sup>[504]</sup></a> Indeed,
badges and crosses were often imposed, and were
in these times a dreadful mark of Cain.<a id='r505' /><a href='#f505' class='c010'><sup>[505]</sup></a> In
1505 two men were sentenced by the archbishop
to wear a faggot (or a badge representing one)
upon the left shoulder, to show that they stood
in danger of the flames.<a id='r506' /><a href='#f506' class='c010'><sup>[506]</sup></a> It would seem they
did, for they were burned alive in 1511.</p>

<p class='c011'>Louis IX. ordered that those who had spoken
indecently should have their tongues pierced and
their upper lips cut away.<a id='r507' /><a href='#f507' class='c010'><sup>[507]</sup></a> Pope Innocent IV.
remonstrated with the king against this
barbarity. The mutilation of the tongue was
a punishment known and inflicted in England
for blasphemy. In 1656 one James Nayler,
“the mad Quaker,” had his tongue pierced with
a hot iron for claiming to be the Messiah.<a id='r508' /><a href='#f508' class='c010'><sup>[508]</sup></a> He
was also whipped at the cart’s tail, and kept in
prison for two years. A drunkard was sometimes
walked about in a barrel, his head protruding
from the top and his hands from two holes
made in its sides.<a id='r509' /><a href='#f509' class='c010'><sup>[509]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>For the village scold<a id='r510' /><a href='#f510' class='c010'><sup>[510]</sup></a> they kept the brank or
bridle of iron, which contained a flat (and for
the unfortunate witches<a id='r511' /><a href='#f511' class='c010'><sup>[511]</sup></a> occasionally a spiked
and painful) gag that went into the mouth and
pressed down the tongue. They might also be
placed in the local ducking chair<a id='r512' /><a href='#f512' class='c010'><sup>[512]</sup></a> and immersed
in water. A remarkable illustration<a id='r513' /><a href='#f513' class='c010'><sup>[513]</sup></a> of the
intensely individual and personal aspect of
primitive penalties<a id='r514' /><a href='#f514' class='c010'><sup>[514]</sup></a> is furnished where—as it
sometimes happened—the prosecutor had himself
to execute his convict assailant, “or dwelle in

  <h2 id='ch02' class='c005'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br /><span class='c008'>THE WITCH TRIALS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Towards the middle of the seventeenth century
there lived at Manningtree a certain Matthew
Hopkins, whose name deserves perhaps to be
recorded. Not that he stands by any means
apart, a veritable Lucifer among the devils.
Sprenger in Germany, Torquemada in Spain,
Grillandus in Italy, de l’Ancre in France, and
other persecutors over Christendom, were better
known and had killed more people. But
Hopkins went to work on English ground. The
people were then professing the same creed that
the majority do now. Shakespeare had been in
his grave more than a generation, and trees may
have been standing as bushes in the fields and
lanes of Essex which will yet renew leaves and
branches at the kiss of coming spring. Hopkins
reveals the spirit of his time, for it has been
wisely observed that every society has the
criminals it deserves. His kind remain with
us still as spies and blackmailers, traitors and
“friendly natives” of the tribe of Judas generally.
But they derive their power to harm from
the community in which they live. Parasites
need a proper “host” to flourish in. A dark
and superstitious age it must have been to
countenance this man; for he was a professional
“discoverer,” or, as he was sometimes called and
styled, Witch-Finder General. He began with
the destruction of some half-dozen persons in his
native hamlet. We cannot determine what
had marked them down—perhaps they were his
private enemies—moral reform has always been
a ready pretext to work vengeance with, and has
been much employed in these latter days. They
may have been old, eccentric, isolated, or insane;
in any case, once seized they had to die, and in
their torments implicated others, most likely
any names conveniently suggested to them.
The fame of the new discoverer spread far and
wide. Towns and hundreds in the eastern county,
and even places far outside its boundaries, sent
to this fell apostle, saying, “Come over and help
us,” and on the track of blood the monster went.
It was his wont to ride upon these expeditions
accompanied by another man, and by a female
searcher, whose services would be required in
the minute personal examinations which were
carried out, especially on women. He made an
open charge of twenty shillings for each village
visited, but no doubt in this nefarious calling
there were other and more profitable ways of
extorting money. Can we not well imagine
what sums may have been paid to him (as they
are to the “sex” blackmailers of to-day) to
avoid accusation? How many may have yielded
their little all to save some one who was dear to
them from common ill-usage, probable death, and
certain disgrace, which such a charge involved?
Who knows how extorted gold might influence
the ordeals enforced? Who shall say what may
have come by stealth to the witch-finders to
bring ruin upon some enemy, perhaps upon
some rival? Who, indeed? From place to
place swooped this bird of prey, descending
on peaceful homesteads and capturing whom
he chose. Woe to the man, and still more to
the woman, who lived alone, who kept a black
cat, or who was found to carry birthmarks on
her body, or to be the least out of the normal
in physical structure! Woe to the person who
was eccentric, subject to fits or trances, or who
might be in any way deranged or of weak intellect!
Woe, in fact, to the unhappy creature
who by any means came in for accusation! The
Pishogue mark would thenceforth be upon them;
relations would drop away as from contamination
with the plague<a id='r516' /><a href='#f516' class='c010'><sup>[516]</sup></a>; and the most brutal rabble of
that time would jostle round, intent upon the
chase, with their fierce lust for blood not the less
keen from the idea that there was something
Christian in their cruelty. The victim would
then be seized and carried off to further interrogation,
ill-treatment, and torture. Parents
and children, comrades and lovers, might weep
in secret, and the boldest might even venture
to denounce the senseless iniquity of the proceedings—at
which they would incur no little
danger. But they would speak unheeded, and
have to linger around the gallows till the final
act, when something swayed and dangled from
a cord.</p>

<p class='c011'>But somehow good Master Matthew began to
be unpopular, and many reasons might account
for it. Perhaps he had been unwise in the
selection of his “subjects”—it looks like it, for
one was an old clergyman—and lived to find
out that some of them had not been quite so
friendless as he may have counted on. Perhaps
the supply of lonely or defenceless folk had given
out, or that in pushing his profession so far
afield he could not estimate the new material.
“Discoveries,” of course, had to be made to keep
up his reputation and his income, and as he
pursued his way through a wide area it may
be that quite a large number of people began
to feel themselves open to accusation, and so
were ready to consider it suspicious that he
alone had such an eye for witches. And then
a whispering rose up amongst them, until it
reached the persecutor’s ears: For sure this
man is aided by the Devil, or else he would not
ferret out so many. And he may well have
started when he saw the anger-light in the
fierce eyes around him, and when he felt at last
the frightful superstitions, which he had kindled
and well thriven on, were out of hand, turned
hard against himself. So he produced a little
book which bears the date of 1647, printed,
he tells us, “For the benefit of the whole
Kingdome.” It has upon the title-page the
somewhat troublesome quotation, “Thou shalt
not suffer a witch to live,” Exodus xxii. 18.
We cannot do better than glance through its
pages and at the “Certain queries answered
which have been and which are likely to be
objected against Matthew Hopkins, in his way
of finding out witches.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Querie I.</i>—That he must needs be the greatest
witch, sorcerer, and wizzard himself, else hee could not
doe it.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Answer.</i>—If Satan’s Kingdome be divided against
itself how shall it stand?</p>

<p class='c009'>The next paragraph is interesting as once more
emphasising the crude and absolutely material
notions conceived of the spiritual world.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Querie II.</i>—If he never went so farre as is before
stated, yet for certaine he met with the devill and
cheated him of his booke, wherein were written all
the witches’ names in England, and if he looks at any
witch he can tell by her countenance what she is; so
by this his helpe is from the devill.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Answer.</i>—If he had been too hard for the devill
and got his booke it had been to his great commendation
and no disgrace at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>It will be noticed that he does not exactly
deny even this report, or appear to consider it at
all unusual to meet the devil walking about
casually. “We must needs argue,” he continues
later, “he is of long standing, above 6000 years,
then he must needs be the best scholar in all
knowledge of Arts and tongues, and so have the
best skill in Physicke, etc.” Mr. Hopkins’ own
skill, he pleads, was really forced on him. “This
discoverer never travelled for it,” he writes in
reply to Querie V., “but in March 1644 he had
some seven or eight of that horrible sect of
witches living in the towne where he lived ...
who every six weeks, in the night (being always
on a Friday night), had their meetings<a id='r517' /><a href='#f517' class='c010'><sup>[517]</sup></a> close by
his house, and had their severall solemne sacrifices
there offered to the devill, one of which this
discoverer heard speaking to her imps one night
and bid them go to another witch, who was thereupon
apprehended and searched by women who
had for many years known the devill’s marks,
and found to have three teats about her, which
honest women have not. So upon command
from the Justice they were to keep her from
sleep two or three nights, expecting in that time
to see her familiars, which the fourth night she
called by their severall names,<a id='r518' /><a href='#f518' class='c010'><sup>[518]</sup></a> and told them
in what shape a quarter of an hour before they
came in, there being ten of us in the roome.<a id='r519' /><a href='#f519' class='c010'><sup>[519]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>“The first she called was (1) Holt, who came
in like a white Kitling. (2) Jamara, who came in
like a fat Spaniel without any legs at all.... (3)
Vinegar Tom, who was like a long legged grey
hound with a head like an Oxe with a long taile
and broad eyes, who, when this discoverer spoke
to and bade him go to the place provided for him
and his angels, immediately transformed himself
into the shape of a child foure years old without
a head and gave half a dozen turns about the
house and vanished at the doore. (4) Sacke and
Sugar, like a black rabbet. (5) Newes, like a
Polcat. All these vanished away in a little
while. Immediately after this witch confessed
severall other witches from whom she had her
imps and named to diverse women where their
marks were ... and imps’ names such as Elimanzer
Pyewacket, Peck-in-the-crown, Grizzell
Greedigut, etc.; which no mortall could invent....
Twenty-nine were condemned at once, four
brought twenty-five miles to be hanged where
their discoverer lives, for sending the devill like a
beare to kill him in his garden; so by seeing
diverse of the men’s papps and trying various
wayes with hundreds of them, he gained the
experience.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Although his dealings must be described as mild
compared with the ghastly inconceivable tortures
in vogue with the inquisitors upon the Continent,<a id='r520' /><a href='#f520' class='c010'><sup>[520]</sup></a>
his victims were yet baited and handled with
the grossest cruelty. They were supposed not
to weep,<a id='r521' /><a href='#f521' class='c010'><sup>[521]</sup></a> being witches, though indeed cause
enough was given them. It is remarkable in
this connection that Shelley,<a id='r522' /><a href='#f522' class='c010'><sup>[522]</sup></a> with how much
accuracy I am not aware, alludes to the “dry
fixed eyeball” of the tortured. Hutchinson<a id='r523' /><a href='#f523' class='c010'><sup>[523]</sup></a>
held this phenomenon to have been due to
prolonged deprivation of sleep and exhaustion.
Doubtless the weary length of the
investigations, and often the age and senile
desiccation of the victims, might easily explain
a state of tearlessness whenever it was really
prevalent.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were supposed to possess an insensible
part in their bodies,<a id='r524' /><a href='#f524' class='c010'><sup>[524]</sup></a> and the examiners
would prick over them to try to find it out.
Especially, a witch was affirmed to have somewhere
upon her person the “Devil’s mark.”
“Some bigg or place upon their body where he”
(the familiar, imp, or spirit) “sucketh them.”<a id='r525' /><a href='#f525' class='c010'><sup>[525]</sup></a>
This alleged “mark” might be almost anything
or nothing; from an abnormal, and perhaps
atavic, teat, down to a birthmark, mole, old
scar, or even a tiny vein under an eyelid.
They were supposed also to float upon being
“swum.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They were, for the most part, wizen, old
creatures, clad in long-used, greasy garments.<a id='r526' /><a href='#f526' class='c010'><sup>[526]</sup></a>
Such skirts would retain much air; they might
be bound so as to favour this, or spread, as with
Ophelia, widely inflated. It was quite likely they
should thus be upborne (and also, for they were
mostly poor and thin, that the heavy, sometimes
chained, Bible should outweigh them in the
ordeal with scales). But ordeals are uncertain
and dangerous unless they can be carefully
manipulated. Mr. Hopkins had been keen on
the water test; it was the finishing touch and
proof at the end of a long series of torments and
examinations.</p>

<p class='c011'>But a day came, it is said, on which a few
brave Englishmen, who had perhaps lost some
one near and dear to them at his hands, laid
hold upon the witch-finder himself, and binding
him in a sack, cast him into a pool. It was a
bold act, in those savage days, to interfere with
any kind of inquisition. Catholic or Puritan, and
was no doubt attended with great risk. But
only for a moment in this case, for there before
them bobbed the dread discoverer of witches,
floating upon the surface of the water; and all
declared the devil got his own. But such an
end was altogether unexpected and unusual; it
was downright bad luck and misfortune, from
Mr. Hopkins’ point of view. His position
appeared unassailable, and indeed probably
would have been, if he had kept to the right
sort of people, and practised on the isolated or
unpopular, who could have been legitimately
sacrificed. All he had done was quite lawful
and regular.</p>

<p class='c011'>Witchcraft, like many acts against religion
and morality, had always been an ecclesiastical
offence, and had been punished in the secular
courts as leading to murder and personal injury,<a id='r527' /><a href='#f527' class='c010'><sup>[527]</sup></a>
and it was made a felony in 1541.<a id='r528' /><a href='#f528' class='c010'><sup>[528]</sup></a> But
it was the (then) recent law of 1603 that
was much in force,<a id='r529' /><a href='#f529' class='c010'><sup>[529]</sup></a> by which, in the quaint
language of the statute, it was forbidden, upon
pain of death, to “employ, feed, or reward an
evil and wicked spirit.”<a id='r530' /><a href='#f530' class='c010'><sup>[530]</sup></a> And since the High
Court of Parliament had recognised witches,<a id='r531' /><a href='#f531' class='c010'><sup>[531]</sup></a>
it became necessary to investigate accusations
and probe for “spirits” through the forms of
law. Thus Hopkins could claim to be a moral
reformer, putting in force the statute of the
realm; he could quote Scripture clearly to his
purpose, the justices and gaolers obeyed his call,
assizes waited to condemn his prisoners. And
if his method seemed superstitious or barbarous,
he could perhaps cite Mr. Perkins’ way,<a id='r532' /><a href='#f532' class='c010'><sup>[532]</sup></a> or could
refer to Mr. Kincaid’s custom in these matters,<a id='r533' /><a href='#f533' class='c010'><sup>[533]</sup></a>
and could quote standard works with precedent
on his side.<a id='r534' /><a href='#f534' class='c010'><sup>[534]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>So he seemed truly to have a safe task and
a paying one, built up upon the prejudices of
the people. But as by their superstitions he
rose, so also by them he fell—utterly, and unpitied.<a id='r535' /><a href='#f535' class='c010'><sup>[535]</sup></a>
It was not his monstrous cruelties, but
“God’s ordeal,” which showed him up, delivered
to the devil; and, in the caustic words of
Samuel Butler, as one “who after proved himself
a witch, and made a rod for his own
breech.”<a id='r536' /><a href='#f536' class='c010'><sup>[536]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>But now, dismissing this particular parasite,
we may review the course of thought upon the
question. Belief in witchcraft is so ancient and
so universal,<a id='r537' /><a href='#f537' class='c010'><sup>[537]</sup></a> that the existing religions, and
perhaps all religions whatsoever, must have
arisen in its atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c011'>From time to time the Christian Church
dealt with the question,<a id='r538' /><a href='#f538' class='c010'><sup>[538]</sup></a> and had elaborated
quite a ritual of tests and remedies. And
it was after nearly fifteen hundred years of
Christianity that Pope Innocent VIII.<a id='r539' /><a href='#f539' class='c010'><sup>[539]</sup></a> issued
a special Bull against all supposed witches
(December 5, 1484), naming one Sprenger, a
Dominican, and Krämar—whose name latinised
to Institor—inquisitors to seek and punish
them; and this they did with frightful cruelty.
They wrote a text-book on their methods
and discoveries about 1489, and kept the
torture chambers busy and the faggots fiercely
burning.</p>

<p class='c011'>Their book was answered by John Wier,
physician to the Duke of Cleves, in 1563.<a id='r540' /><a href='#f540' class='c010'><sup>[540]</sup></a> He
refuted many of the grosser superstitions prevailing,
and also suggested that the devil deceived
people and made many confess to impossible
practices;<a id='r541' /><a href='#f541' class='c010'><sup>[541]</sup></a> likewise, that the witches did not
really occasion the illnesses and calamities which
they were accused of causing and even admitted
having brought about.<a id='r542' /><a href='#f542' class='c010'><sup>[542]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>At first the work awakened only controversy
and condemnation—a stage in advance, however,
since the most wronged are generally undefended,
and pass to their doom in silence and with no
one to speak for them.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1580 Bodin, a French writer, published a
most furious attack on Dr. Wier, declaring him
to have been the pupil of a sorcerer and that he
wrote inspired by the devil. He reiterated all
the old fantastic stories as being true, and in
the hideous procedure of investigation which
he set forth, applied such diverse and such
agonising torments as could not have been
surpassed by any of the earlier inquisitors.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bodin in turn was answered, from England,
by Reginald Scot, in 1584, who wrote a long
and powerful review of the witch persecutions,
in which he quotes extensively from Sprenger,
Bodin, and the Continental tormentors. Full
of wise saws and modern instances, he cast
doubts on the rationale of the witchcraft tests
and trials.</p>

<p class='c011'>But although just a century had gone by
since Innocent launched his Bull from the Papal
throne, many poor people, some at that time
unborn, were destined still to suffer trial and
torture. And more than another century had
to pass before the law would leave “witches”
alone; before afflicted, half-mad, or unpopular
old women could throw crumbs to the sparrows
upon the snow, or keep a cat, without danger of
death. King James, as a young man, fell foul of
both Scot and Wier in 1597. Speaking of them
he said: “One called Scot, an Englishman, is not
ashamed in publicke print to deny that there
can be such a thing as witchcraft, and so he
maintains the old error of the Sadducees in
denying spirits. The other called Wierus, a
German phisition, sets out a publick apologie
for al these craftes-folkes—whereby procuring
for their impunitie he plainly betrayes himselfe
to have been one of their profession”; and
six years later came his grotesque law already
alluded to, sanctioned with all the weight of
Parliament.<a id='r543' /><a href='#f543' class='c010'><sup>[543]</sup></a> The trials in Germany were
severely criticised in 1631 by Father Spee, who
published his book at first anonymously,<a id='r544' /><a href='#f544' class='c010'><sup>[544]</sup></a> and
checked the ardour and the cruelty of the
courts.</p>

<p class='c011'>But they were defended again by Joseph
Glanvil,<a id='r545' /><a href='#f545' class='c010'><sup>[545]</sup></a> chaplain to the king, in 1681. About
this time Dr. Bekker, a clergyman, living in
Holland, compiled four lengthy volumes about
witchcraft,<a id='r546' /><a href='#f546' class='c010'><sup>[546]</sup></a> in which he contended that neither
devils nor spirits could act on mankind. In
England, ten years later, wrote Richard Baxter,<a id='r547' /><a href='#f547' class='c010'><sup>[547]</sup></a>
author of <i>The Saints’ Rest</i> and other evangelical
works which were widely read, supporting the
weird beliefs of the witchcraft schoolmen.</p>

<p class='c011'>By this time the persecutions, which were
waning in England, had broken out at Salem
in America; and we find Cotton Mather (like
Glanvil, a divine, and F.R.S.) writing a little
book<a id='r548' /><a href='#f548' class='c010'><sup>[548]</sup></a> to justify their existence<a id='r549' /><a href='#f549' class='c010'><sup>[549]</sup></a> (and his own
conduct, for many were sceptical), upon that
continent where, as he quaintly says, the
Pilgrim Fathers “imagined that they should
leave their posterity in a place where they
should never see the inroads of Profanity or
Superstition.” The records of the nineteen
executions in this neighbourhood, of one poor
creature who was pressed to death, and of the
crowd of unhappy suspects who were cast
into the prison,<a id='r550' /><a href='#f550' class='c010'><sup>[550]</sup></a> show how the frenzy of this
murderous “revival” swept like an epidemic
down upon the settlement,<a id='r551' /><a href='#f551' class='c010'><sup>[551]</sup></a> so that for fifteen
months the air seemed charged and laden with
hysteria, and are a grim commentary. But
evolution operates even on taboos and superstitions,
and this was probably the last general
persecution, and Bishop Hutchinson called his
learned work <i>An Historical Essay</i>,<a id='r552' /><a href='#f552' class='c010'><sup>[552]</sup></a> for it was
dealing mainly with the past. The law lagged
behind, however, as it generally does, the statute
of James I. (1603) being, when Hutchinson wrote,
“now in force” in 1718.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so it continued for eighteen years longer,
until repealed in 1736.<a id='r553' /><a href='#f553' class='c010'><sup>[553]</sup></a> In Ireland the law
lasted until 1821. Witchcraft was clearly kept
alive by theology. People who really believed
in a personal devil (and even those who
questioned the witch convictions assumed the
devil to be very much alive), designing mischief
and disguised everywhere, could easily accept
tales of familiar spirits.<a id='r554' /><a href='#f554' class='c010'><sup>[554]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Those who received the Hebrew and Christian
records as altogether inspired, could not ignore
possession and sorcery.<a id='r555' /><a href='#f555' class='c010'><sup>[555]</sup></a> “Après que Dieu a
parlé,” says de l’Ancre, “de sa propre bouche
des magiciens et sorciers, qui est l’incrédule qui
en peut justement douter?”<a id='r556' /><a href='#f556' class='c010'><sup>[556]</sup></a> And Sir Matthew
Hale said in his summing up: “That there were
such creatures as witches, he made no doubt at
all. For, first, the Scriptures had affirmed so
much; secondly, the wisdom of all nations had
provided laws against such persons, which is an
argument of their confidence of such a crime.”<a id='r557' /><a href='#f557' class='c010'><sup>[557]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Speaking of a particular case, Mr. H. L.
Stephen<a id='r558' /><a href='#f558' class='c010'><sup>[558]</sup></a> quotes Campbell as follows: “...
During the trial the imposture practised by the
prosecutors was detected and exposed. Hales’
motives were most laudable; but he furnished a
memorable instance of the mischief originating
from superstition. He was afraid of an acquittal
or a pardon, lest countenance should be given
to a disbelief in witchcraft, which he considered
tantamount to disbelief in Christianity.” Glanvil<a id='r559' /><a href='#f559' class='c010'><sup>[559]</sup></a>
follows on the same side, arguing with great
ingenuity from the scriptural point of view
(for instance, in dealing with certain doctrines
as to the fate of unbaptized children, p. 22).
“The question whether there are witches or
not,” he begins in Part ii., “is not a matter of
vain speculation or of indifferent moment, but
an inquiry of very great and weighty importance.
For on the resolution of it depends the authority
of our laws, and, which is more, our religion,
in its main doctrines, is nearly concerned.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And what may be called the religious belief
in witches<a id='r560' /><a href='#f560' class='c010'><sup>[560]</sup></a>—a very different thing from the
torturing of them—outlived the penal laws
concerning them.<a id='r561' /><a href='#f561' class='c010'><sup>[561]</sup></a> The Rev. John Brown of
Haddington (1703–1791)<a href='#f561' class='c010'><sup>[561]</sup></a> complained of the
repeal of King James’s Act,<a id='r562' /><a href='#f562' class='c010'><sup>[562]</sup></a> and even John Wesley
(1722–1787) declared that giving up witchcraft
is, in effect, giving up the Bible.<a id='r563' /><a href='#f563' class='c010'><sup>[563]</sup></a> On page 366
of the journal<a id='r564' /><a href='#f564' class='c010'><sup>[564]</sup></a> which he edited we read: “With
my latest breath will I bear testimony against
giving up to infidels one great proof of the
invisible world. I mean that of witchcraft and
apparitions, confirmed by the testimony of all
ages”;<a id='r565' /><a href='#f565' class='c010'><sup>[565]</sup></a> and Huxley<a id='r566' /><a href='#f566' class='c010'><sup>[566]</sup></a> alluded to a contemporary
clergyman who had been preaching diabolical
agency. Nor did the actual persecutions cease
altogether, and though the last legal trial in
England took place in 1712<a id='r567' /><a href='#f567' class='c010'><sup>[567]</sup></a> (the last execution
in Europe is given by Lecky<a id='r568' /><a href='#f568' class='c010'><sup>[568]</sup></a> as occurring in
Switzerland in 1782; another authority mentions
Posen,<a id='r569' /><a href='#f569' class='c010'><sup>[569]</sup></a> with date 1793), sporadic outrages continued
in the country, and persist in a modified
form to the present day.<a id='r570' /><a href='#f570' class='c010'><sup>[570]</sup></a> At Clonmel, Ireland,
in 1895,<a id='r571' /><a href='#f571' class='c010'><sup>[571]</sup></a> a poor old woman was placed upon the
kitchen fire by her own family and burned, so
that she died from the effects.<a id='r572' /><a href='#f572' class='c010'><sup>[572]</sup></a> But what were
once pious customs and duties had at length
become crimes, and the chief mover in this latest
witch trial got (to the best of my recollection)
twenty years’ penal servitude.</p>

<p class='c011'>A belief so universal as that in witchcraft
must clearly be founded upon positive phenomena.
It will not serve our purpose to discuss what yet
unknown supernormal powers might be attained
under special conditions, or how much more
there may be to discover beyond X-rays and
wireless telegraphy. For while old ideas as to
imps and devils, brooms and black cats, were
manifestly ridiculous, and although the abnormal
powers, whatever they may have been, could
work no rescue in the hour of need, there may
be many things in heaven and earth undreamed
of in our present state of knowledge. But
ordinary witch cases appear to have been resolvable
into the examination of—</p>

<p class='c011'>(<i>a</i>) Hysterical subjects—sometimes crowds of
them—who might imagine anything and accuse
anybody, including themselves. Such people
were (and are) often given to swallowing needles
and other things, some of which found their way
through the body and emerged from all parts of
it.<a id='r573' /><a href='#f573' class='c010'><sup>[573]</sup></a> This would have been considered strong
evidence of diabolical agency. Many of these
would be subject to epilepsy, catalepsy—accompanied
sometimes by that strange insensibility
to pain<a id='r574' /><a href='#f574' class='c010'><sup>[574]</sup></a> which is a well-marked
symptom in hysteria, and which was remarked on
by the torturers—and to obscure nerve diseases
generally.</p>

<p class='c011'>(<i>b</i>) “Wise women,”<a id='r575' /><a href='#f575' class='c010'><sup>[575]</sup></a> midwives, doctors good
and bad, who may, according to the custom of
the times in which, as among savages, magic<a id='r576' /><a href='#f576' class='c010'><sup>[576]</sup></a>
and medicine were inextricably mingled, have
resorted to charms<a id='r577' /><a href='#f577' class='c010'><sup>[577]</sup></a> (as are still employed by
old women to cure warts), and sometimes, doubtless,
to preparing and administering actual
poisons;<a id='r578' /><a href='#f578' class='c010'><sup>[578]</sup></a> and who, whenever anything remarkable
occurred, were always liable to be accused
of having in some way trafficked with the all-explaining
devil.<a id='r579' /><a href='#f579' class='c010'><sup>[579]</sup></a> They sometimes claimed
to possess the powers of witches, and tried
to gain support or protection from being
feared, deceiving others and often themselves
as well.<a id='r580' /><a href='#f580' class='c010'><sup>[580]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>(<i>c</i>) Private enemies,<a id='r581' /><a href='#f581' class='c010'><sup>[581]</sup></a> whom an accusation of
witchcraft,<a id='r582' /><a href='#f582' class='c010'><sup>[582]</sup></a> or of any of the little group of
offences<a id='r583' /><a href='#f583' class='c010'><sup>[583]</sup></a> which were always supposed to be
closely allied with it,<a id='r584' /><a href='#f584' class='c010'><sup>[584]</sup></a> was the readiest way to
ruin.<a id='r585' /><a href='#f585' class='c010'><sup>[585]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>(<i>d</i>) People accused for the sake of gain by
means of deliberate plots and conspiracies.
Feigning to be bewitched, and naming some
(known to be) innocent person as the cause of
the mischief, was a mean crime that was by no
means uncommon, and many flagrant instances
are given of it by early criticisers.<a id='r586' /><a href='#f586' class='c010'><sup>[586]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>(<i>e</i>) The main body of the victims.<a id='r587' /><a href='#f587' class='c010'><sup>[587]</sup></a> Old
women who had outlived family and friends,
who were helpless and solitary,<a id='r588' /><a href='#f588' class='c010'><sup>[588]</sup></a> ugly from age,
unclean from infirmities, eccentric in wisdom,
crazy with delusions, palsied in limbs, or wandering
in mind.<a id='r589' /><a href='#f589' class='c010'><sup>[589]</sup></a> All these, or nearly half the old
folks in the land, were always liable to accusation
on account of their misfortunes.<a id='r590' /><a href='#f590' class='c010'><sup>[590]</sup></a> They
were the wretched scapegoats of those times, on
whom was laid whatever might befall, from
epileptic fits to summer hail.<a id='r591' /><a href='#f591' class='c010'><sup>[591]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>It was a crime imputed with so much ease and repelled with so
much difficulty, that the powerful, whenever they wanted to ruin
the weak, ... had only to accuse them of witchcraft to secure their
destruction.—C. Mackay, <i>Popular Delusions</i>, p. 109. A certain G.
Naudé, “late Library Keeper to Cardinal Mazarin,” wrote a book,
entitled <i>The History of Magic</i>, “By way of apology for all the wise
men who have unjustly been reputed magicians from the creation
to the present age.” Englished by J. Davies. London, 1657.]</p>

<p class='c011'>(<i>f</i>) The people denounced by prisoners under
torture. As we have seen, accusation meant
examination, and this had two objects: to extort
a “confession” from the suspected witch, and to
compel her to reveal accomplices. Some might
confess at once, and did so in the hope of execution
(the <i>kind</i> of confession required was already
well known, and the more monstrous and
elaborate it might be, the better would be the
chance of escaping torture). Others would
naturally deny taking part in abominations in
which they had not engaged, and most of which
were beyond possibility. And no doubt nearly
all would make a long and desperate struggle
against incriminating their unfortunate friends,
who might, however innocent of crime, be also
other people’s enemies. And so the accursed
ingenuity of man was practised on these miserable
victims of his ignorance and superstition. One
hideous device<a id='r592' /><a href='#f592' class='c010'><sup>[592]</sup></a> tried by a Frankish king was to
drive sharp spikes underneath the nails;<a id='r593' /><a href='#f593' class='c010'><sup>[593]</sup></a> this,
he contended, always induced confession from the
intense anguish. Very likely it did.</p>

<p class='c011'>Other inquisitors went their own sweet way,
and used all possible varieties of the question,
that they might make out of the shrieks and
ravings the sort of story they expected and
prompted,<a id='r594' /><a href='#f594' class='c010'><sup>[594]</sup></a> and lash more suspects down upon
the rack. No wonder, then, that persecution
spread;<a id='r595' /><a href='#f595' class='c010'><sup>[595]</sup></a> the aged and the disordered were always
there, and any one of these might be thought a
witch,<a id='r596' /><a href='#f596' class='c010'><sup>[596]</sup></a> or find herself denounced from the torture-room—perhaps
by a lifelong friend.</p>

<p class='c011'>The readiness with which all “evidence” was
acclaimed and the appalling means by which it
was got together placed any abnormal person
in constant peril, and will account for the
enormous numbers of the implicated. Tens of
thousands of victims, says Lecky,<a id='r597' /><a href='#f597' class='c010'><sup>[597]</sup></a> perished by
the most agonising and protracted torments
without exciting the faintest compassion. In a
single German city they used to burn 300 witches
annually.<a id='r598' /><a href='#f598' class='c010'><sup>[598]</sup></a> In Nancy, 800 were put to death by
a judge in the course of sixteen years.<a id='r599' /><a href='#f599' class='c010'><sup>[599]</sup></a> Zachary
Gray,<a id='r600' /><a href='#f600' class='c010'><sup>[600]</sup></a> who edited an edition of <i>Hudibras</i>,
claims that during the Long Parliament 500
witches were executed each year, and that he read
through a list of no less than 3000 of them.<a id='r601' /><a href='#f601' class='c010'><sup>[601]</sup></a>
The total of Great Britain has been estimated
at 30,000,<a id='r602' /><a href='#f602' class='c010'><sup>[602]</sup></a> and it has been estimated that during
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the witch
death-roll for Europe<a id='r603' /><a href='#f603' class='c010'><sup>[603]</sup></a> reached 200,000 people.<a id='r604' /><a href='#f604' class='c010'><sup>[604]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Perhaps the sidelights give a more graphic
conception of what went on in those dark days
of error. Listen to this complaint of a French
writer<a id='r605' /><a href='#f605' class='c010'><sup>[605]</sup></a> who evidently thought he was approaching
the “last days.” “Was it [sorcery] ever so
much in vogue as here in this unhappy
[sixteenth] century? The benches of our courts
are all blackened by them; there are not sufficient
magistrates to hear the cases. Our prisons are
gorged with witches, and not a day passes but
our warrants are ensanguined with them, and
we return saddened to our homes, shocked at the
ghastly and appalling things that they confess.”
And in our own land, about fifty years later,
we come upon a letter written to Sir Edmund
Spencer in 1647: “Within the compass of two
years near upon 300 witches were arraigned, and
the greater part executed, in Essex and Suffolk
only. Scotland swarms with them now more than
ever, and persons of good quality executed daily.”<a id='r606' /><a href='#f606' class='c010'><sup>[606]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>It was in Scotland, likewise, that there used
to be kept a chest “locked with three severall
locks and opened every fifteenth daie,”<a id='r607' /><a href='#f607' class='c010'><sup>[607]</sup></a> which
might receive, as did the Lion’s Mouth at Venice,
denunciations slipped in secretly; and that in
1661 the justices were ordered to attend certain
towns to hear cases of witchcraft at least once a
week.<a id='r608' /><a href='#f608' class='c010'><sup>[608]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The witch trials are ended. So far as <i>they</i>
are concerned, we can look back from the heights
of history over this vast red sea of superstition
which has swallowed up such multitudes. And
to think it was all so useless, so unnecessary!<a id='r609' /><a href='#f609' class='c010'><sup>[609]</sup></a>
but yet by no means hard to be explained. The
underlying and provocative phenomena had
really been present in a huge number of cases
(and when they were not, were fervently conceived,
and so suggested, looked for, and enforced
as to set up all kinds of hallucinations in the
accusers and sometimes in the accused), and in
default of tracing out their causes,<a id='r610' /><a href='#f610' class='c010'><sup>[610]</sup></a> evident or
recondite, clergy and jurists, and of course the
populace, gave out a false and thaumaturgical
account of them. They were correct in affirming
many amazing facts and phenomena (and all these
persist, for nature has not changed.<a id='r611' /><a href='#f611' class='c010'><sup>[611]</sup></a> There are at
least as many abnormal and half-mad people
amongst us now as there ever were, only we treat
the clearer cases kindly, and are no longer afraid of
mythical influences), although these were magnified
and multiplied million-fold, for Superstition
is a monster that grows by feeding. They were
fantastic in their fabulous explanations of them.
The rest—in those cruel times when torture was
as common as is cross-examination—followed
quite naturally. The doctors, theological and
legal, erred in their diagnosis, mistaking diseases
for devils and abnormality for magic. We
shall come upon this again, crass and close at
hand. May the Future condemn the Present,
as we now deplore the Past.</p>

  <h2 id='ch03' class='c005'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br /><span class='c008'>TREATMENT OF THE INSANE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>As the abnormal and the rationally eccentric
were considered witches, and held to have been
disciples of the devil, so the more obviously
sense-bereft were thought to be controlled by the
fiends within them. Both witches and lunatics
were held to be beneath the sway of infernal
powers, but the former as willing agents of the
devil, and the latter as involuntary victims, who
were deemed to be possessed. In ancient Egypt,
by the Temple of Saturn,<a id='r612' /><a href='#f612' class='c010'><sup>[612]</sup></a> in classic Greece with
the Asclepieia, and by the laws of Pagan Rome,<a id='r613' /><a href='#f613' class='c010'><sup>[613]</sup></a>
the mentally afflicted were treated with humanity,
and, if without the aid of our present science, at
least upon the same broad principles which we
adopt to-day.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the warm sunlight of the Eastern lands
the life of the population was spent in the open
air. As we read in the Scriptures and in books
of travel, the lunatic might dwell amidst the
tombs. He could wander through the soothing
cypress groves in the moonlight or lie under
shading palm in the noontide heat. He dwelt
apart, like the leper, cut off by his terrible infirmity
from the kinship of reason, but free at
least in the air and sunlight, and often allowed
a quite especial licence<a id='r614' /><a href='#f614' class='c010'><sup>[614]</sup></a> as being in the guardianship
of God.<a id='r615' /><a href='#f615' class='c010'><sup>[615]</sup></a> But the troublesome conduct into
which lunatics were ever liable to be led<a id='r616' /><a href='#f616' class='c010'><sup>[616]</sup></a> would
frequently rouse the instinct of retaliation, and
bring down swift and heavy punishment upon
them.<a id='r617' /><a href='#f617' class='c010'><sup>[617]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>In Europe also and in England the less-dangerous
lunatics “were allowed to wander
about the country,<a id='r618' /><a href='#f618' class='c010'><sup>[618]</sup></a> beggars and vagabonds,
affording sport<a id='r619' /><a href='#f619' class='c010'><sup>[619]</sup></a> and mockery.” We get a vivid
glimpse from Shakespeare of that “poor Tom<a id='r620' /><a href='#f620' class='c010'><sup>[620]</sup></a>
that eats the swimming frog, the toad, the tadpole,
the wall newt and the water newt, that in
the fury of his heart, when the foul fiend rages,
eats cow-dung for sallets, swallows the old rat
and the ditch dog, drinks the green mantle of
the slimy pool;<a id='r621' /><a href='#f621' class='c010'><sup>[621]</sup></a> who is whipt from tything to
tything, and stocked, punished, and imprisoned.”<a id='r622' /><a href='#f622' class='c010'><sup>[622]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>This was the lot of sufferers in those times,
and beyond doubt a certain number of them,
unmindful or unheedful of savage laws, obeyed
the obsessing suicidal impulse which is so common
among mad people; and through this many of
the most afflicted must have been taken, in the
mercy of nature, out of the world of men in
which they had no part. But if the half-witted
poor were allowed to wander,<a id='r623' /><a href='#f623' class='c010'><sup>[623]</sup></a> those of the richer
class were less fortunate. Their families were
shy and ashamed of them; they were concealed
and locked in garrets and cellars, or penned apart,
secured in sheds and outhouses—fastened up
anywhere about the premises.<a id='r624' /><a href='#f624' class='c010'><sup>[624]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Medicines there were indeed for the insane
patients, and some of them might have added
to the witches’ cauldron.<a id='r625' /><a href='#f625' class='c010'><sup>[625]</sup></a> Among the less
nauseous of these came wolf’s and lion’s flesh,<a id='r626' /><a href='#f626' class='c010'><sup>[626]</sup></a>
and as our Saxon forefathers were skilled
herbalists, we find the clovewort, polion, and
peony recommended,<a id='r627' /><a href='#f627' class='c010'><sup>[627]</sup></a> also the mandrake, round
which many stories were woven from its resemblance
to the human form. They said:
“For witlessness, that is, for devil sickness or
demoniacal possession, take from the body of
the same wort mandrake by weight of three
pennies, administer to drink in warm water
as he may find convenient; soon he will be
healed.”<a id='r628' /><a href='#f628' class='c010'><sup>[628]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Doubtless in all civilisations the more acutely
insane would have to be a care for the community.<a id='r629' /><a href='#f629' class='c010'><sup>[629]</sup></a>
The early Christians tended them in their
churches, in which they stood in a special part,<a id='r630' /><a href='#f630' class='c010'><sup>[630]</sup></a>
and where they were provided with food “while
they abode in the church, which, it seems, was the
chief place of their residence and habitation.”<a id='r631' /><a href='#f631' class='c010'><sup>[631]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The monks to some extent looked after them
in their monasteries.<a id='r632' /><a href='#f632' class='c010'><sup>[632]</sup></a> But whatever medicines
or other remedies they may have employed, the
main idea of those days about lunacy was that
it came through demoniacal possession. The
object was to drive the devils out. To accomplish
this they seem to have resorted to all sorts of
incongruous “cures,” both ghostly and physical.<a id='r633' /><a href='#f633' class='c010'><sup>[633]</sup></a>
The great spiritual weapon has always been
exorcism. This was the primal art of all religions,
and it was practised also by the early
Christians.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the third century the exorcists were formed
into a special order.<a id='r634' /><a href='#f634' class='c010'><sup>[634]</sup></a> “When an exorcist is
ordained,” we read, “he shall receive at the
hands of the bishop a book wherein the forms of
exorcism are written. These forms were certain
passages together with adjurations in the name
of Christ commanding the unclean spirit to
depart out of the possessed person.” This custom
has continued through the centuries,<a id='r635' /><a href='#f635' class='c010'><sup>[635]</sup></a> forming
the subject of innumerable legends and pictures
relating to saints and teachers in the middle
ages; and though the practice seems to be in
abeyance,<a id='r636' /><a href='#f636' class='c010'><sup>[636]</sup></a> the old idea of exorcism is not dead.
We must perceive this when we read,<a id='r637' /><a href='#f637' class='c010'><sup>[637]</sup></a> for instance,
“Water and salt are exorcised by the priest, and
so withdrawn from the power of Satan, who,
since the Fall, has corrupted and abused even
inanimate things.<a id='r638' /><a href='#f638' class='c010'><sup>[638]</sup></a> But besides the weapons,
mystic and spiritual, employed by the Church,
were others of a more corporeal character.</p>

<p class='c011'>The patients were bound to venerated crosses
at evening, to be released as cured in the
morning.<a id='r639' /><a href='#f639' class='c010'><sup>[639]</sup></a> They were chained fast to stones in
various churches; they were dipped into holy
wells—this custom lasted in Cornwall to modern
times; and they were sent as pilgrims to shrines,<a id='r640' /><a href='#f640' class='c010'><sup>[640]</sup></a>
at some of which they underwent a regular
course of treatment; music was often an
important element.<a id='r641' /><a href='#f641' class='c010'><sup>[641]</sup></a> And remedies far more
drastic might be provided, which relied not so
much upon the power of the saints as on the
human weakness of the devils.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus, scattered among the recipes for herbs
and all the indescribable filthy mixtures which
were advocated for insanity,<a id='r642' /><a href='#f642' class='c010'><sup>[642]</sup></a> we come across the
following prescription, the effects of which would
prove anything but imaginary:—“In case a man
be a lunatic, take skin of a mereswine or porpoise,
work it into a whip, swinge the man well therewith,
soon he will be well. Amen.” At one
monastery the lunatics in the charge of the
monks are said to have received ten lashes every
day.<a id='r643' /><a href='#f643' class='c010'><sup>[643]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The insane have been flogged for various
reasons:—(1) Superstitiously, to drive out the
devil, and even to scare away a disease; (2)
therapeutically, because pain and shock would
often subdue the ravings of the patients, although
only temporarily; (3) instinctively, as a relief
to their keepers’ feelings. The medical and the
brutal whippings we shall meet again later on,
long after devil-driving had been abandoned,
though it prevailed through Christendom for
probably over sixteen hundred years. To understand
it we must turn aside to savages.</p>

<p class='c011'>Primitive peoples,<a id='r644' /><a href='#f644' class='c010'><sup>[644]</sup></a> like children, <i>personified</i>
everything. Disease appeared to be a sort of
personal entity—like that deceitful dream<a id='r645' /><a href='#f645' class='c010'><sup>[645]</sup></a> Zeus
sent to Agamemnon—a “thing” “to be drawn
out in an invisible form, and burnt in the fire or
thrown into the water.” A foe invisible, but yet
so human in its limitations as to be stopped by
thorns placed in its path.<a id='r646' /><a href='#f646' class='c010'><sup>[646]</sup></a> And if all manner of
physical ailments were looked upon as being, or,
at any rate, as emanating from personal demons,
much more would such a fearful and mysterious
affliction as insanity be held to indicate a devil’s
presence and immediate handiwork.<a id='r647' /><a href='#f647' class='c010'><sup>[647]</sup></a> Moreover,
to the primitive mind, the demons of all sorts
were much too near, too vividly conceived, too
real, too commonplace, to be regarded as spiritual
beings within the modern meaning of the word.
They were conceived as obviously living and
moving about,<a id='r648' /><a href='#f648' class='c010'><sup>[648]</sup></a> and therefore as being human in
their character. Thus among savages “the
souls of the dead are thought susceptible of being
beaten, hurt, and driven like any other living
creatures,”<a id='r649' /><a href='#f649' class='c010'><sup>[649]</sup></a> and demons could be hunted out of
the houses and scared away to woods and outer
darkness.<a id='r650' /><a href='#f650' class='c010'><sup>[650]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The ideas of the profoundly superstitious
middle ages resembled these. Even the great
opponent or accuser, Satan, who was restored by
Milton to the rôle of Ahriman,<a id='r651' /><a href='#f651' class='c010'><sup>[651]</sup></a> was but a wretched
creature, a poor devil,<a id='r652' /><a href='#f652' class='c010'><sup>[652]</sup></a> in the popular imagination.
“He” is continually outwitted like the pantomime
policeman,<a id='r653' /><a href='#f653' class='c010'><sup>[653]</sup></a> and nonplussed by the shallowest
equivocations.<a id='r654' /><a href='#f654' class='c010'><sup>[654]</sup></a> He beats a man<a id='r655' /><a href='#f655' class='c010'><sup>[655]</sup></a> and is beaten
and vanquished.<a id='r656' /><a href='#f656' class='c010'><sup>[656]</sup></a> He aims a stone at Dunstan
and misses,<a id='r657' /><a href='#f657' class='c010'><sup>[657]</sup></a> and when seized by the nose with
pincers, his bellowings are heard for three miles
round.<a id='r658' /><a href='#f658' class='c010'><sup>[658]</sup></a> He howls when sprinkled with holy
water,<a id='r659' /><a href='#f659' class='c010'><sup>[659]</sup></a> and Luther hurls an inkstand at his head.<a id='r660' /><a href='#f660' class='c010'><sup>[660]</sup></a>
This man-like and material monster of course
felt pain, and when he took up his abode in a
human body he was supposed to feel the blows
inflicted on the sufferer.<a id='r661' /><a href='#f661' class='c010'><sup>[661]</sup></a> It was the devil (or
his representative) who might be driven out of
man or woman; the demons could be commanded
to quit each portion of the invaded body, member
by member.<a id='r662' /><a href='#f662' class='c010'><sup>[662]</sup></a> The fiends were supposed to
writhe in anguish<a id='r663' /><a href='#f663' class='c010'><sup>[663]</sup></a> when the possessed cowered
beneath salt water or the whip.<a id='r664' /><a href='#f664' class='c010'><sup>[664]</sup></a> On <i>them</i> the
curses and the stripes were meant to descend,<a id='r665' /><a href='#f665' class='c010'><sup>[665]</sup></a>
until at last, through unendurable torments,
they fled the body by the nearest orifice.<a id='r666' /><a href='#f666' class='c010'><sup>[666]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>This crude and savage way of expelling
“devils” was long continued; belief in it is
probably by no means dead in the minds of some
countryfolk. Hawthorne, writing of the seventeenth
century Puritans,<a id='r667' /><a href='#f667' class='c010'><sup>[667]</sup></a> makes the gaoler say of
his prisoner, “Verily she hath been like a possessed
one, and there lacks but little that I should take
in hand to drive Satan out of her with stripes.”
But there were times enough when exorcism
failed and flogging proved unavailing. Then
the insane would have to be restrained and
subjected to some sort of treatment<a id='r668' /><a href='#f668' class='c010'><sup>[668]</sup></a>—to say
some sort of <i>ill-treatment</i> were nearer the truth.
Doubtless they always aimed at quieting the
more troublesome patients, and bringing them
into order, if not back to reason.</p>

<p class='c011'>Says Andrew Boorde in his strange <i>Regyment
of Health</i>:<a id='r669' /><a href='#f669' class='c010'><sup>[669]</sup></a> “I do advertyse every mā the which
is mad or lunaticke or frenticke or demoniacke,
to be kept in save garde in some close house or
chambre where there is lytell lyght. And that
he have a keper the which the mad man do
feare.” The same idea we see expressed by
Shakespeare:<a id='r670' /><a href='#f670' class='c010'><sup>[670]</sup></a> “We’ll have him in a dark room
and bound,” is the immediate cry towards the
mad. Shut up and bound they were, in all
manner of ways and places, by relatives, monks,
and keepers. As we have seen, many were
executed as witches or malefactors, and would
be thrown into gatehouses and prisons,<a id='r671' /><a href='#f671' class='c010'><sup>[671]</sup></a> where
they might furnish horrible diversion for the
other prisoners,<a id='r672' /><a href='#f672' class='c010'><sup>[672]</sup></a> and where they were sometimes
drugged to make them silent and to cease from
raving.<a id='r673' /><a href='#f673' class='c010'><sup>[673]</sup></a> Sometimes they were placed in such
hospitals as there were,<a id='r674' /><a href='#f674' class='c010'><sup>[674]</sup></a> along with fever and
accident cases.<a id='r675' /><a href='#f675' class='c010'><sup>[675]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>In the course of time, as population spread
and townships grew, the old resorts were found
to be inadequate. The number of the lunatics
was increasing, and the whole country was
filling up and enclosing. Whipping from place
to place became ineffective, and there had been
no public institutions available but monasteries,
gaols, and hospitals.<a id='r676' /><a href='#f676' class='c010'><sup>[676]</sup></a> In the year 1247 was
founded by Bishopsgate the Priory of St. Mary
of Bethlem,<a id='r677' /><a href='#f677' class='c010'><sup>[677]</sup></a> and here insane people were kept
and tended, at any rate from 1403. Doubtless
there came to be other places thus put to use,
such as, for instance, one St. Katherine’s by the
Tower,<a id='r678' /><a href='#f678' class='c010'><sup>[678]</sup></a> where, we are told, “they used to keep
the better sort of mad folks.” But it was not
until about the middle of the eighteenth century<a id='r679' /><a href='#f679' class='c010'><sup>[679]</sup></a>
that grim and sombre circumvallate buildings
began to be erected to intern the troublesome.<a id='r680' /><a href='#f680' class='c010'><sup>[680]</sup></a>
“They were,” says Dr. Conolly,<a id='r681' /><a href='#f681' class='c010'><sup>[681]</sup></a> “but prisons of
the worst description. Small openings in the
walls, unglazed, or whether glazed or not, guarded
with strong iron bars, narrow corridors, dark
cells, desolate courts, where no tree nor shrub
nor flower nor blade of grass grew.<a id='r682' /><a href='#f682' class='c010'><sup>[682]</sup></a> Solitariness,
or companionship so indiscriminate as to be
worse than solitude; terrible attendants armed
with whips ... and free to impose manacles
and chains and stripes at their own brutal
will; uncleanness, semi-starvation, the garrotte,
and unpunished murders—these were the
characteristics of such buildings throughout
Europe.” What may be called the theoretical
treatment was bad enough. Those who could
not be cured must be subdued;<a id='r683' /><a href='#f683' class='c010'><sup>[683]</sup></a> the teaching of
Boerhaave and Cullen admitted this, and the
latter wrote: “Fear being the passion that
diminishes excitement, may therefore be opposed
to the excess of it, and particularly to the angry
and irascible excitement of maniacs; these being
more susceptible of fear than might be expected,
it appears to me to have been commonly useful.”<a id='r684' /><a href='#f684' class='c010'><sup>[684]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>It was desired “to acquire some awe over
them,”<a id='r685' /><a href='#f685' class='c010'><sup>[685]</sup></a> and he declares that “sometimes it may
be necessary to acquire it even by stripes and
blows.”<a id='r686' /><a href='#f686' class='c010'><sup>[686]</sup></a> This was the therapeutic flogging
already alluded to.<a id='r687' /><a href='#f687' class='c010'><sup>[687]</sup></a> Shock, terror, blistering,
bleeding, purging, the use of chains and all
manner of manacles<a id='r688' /><a href='#f688' class='c010'><sup>[688]</sup></a>—these were the means
employed and set down in the textbooks to
heal the disordered mechanism of the brain.<a id='r689' /><a href='#f689' class='c010'><sup>[689]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>In the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> of 1765<a id='r690' /><a href='#f690' class='c010'><sup>[690]</sup></a> we
read of the private asylums that “persons were
taken forcibly to these houses without any
authority, instantly seized by a set of inhuman
ruffians trained up to this barbarous profession,
stripped naked, and conveyed to a dark room.”
So ignorant were the doctors of those days as to
the nature of insanity that the harsh cruelties
practised on private patients were carried out
even upon the king. Of the eighteenth-century
practice Mr. Massie has written:<a id='r691' /><a href='#f691' class='c010'><sup>[691]</sup></a> “Mental disease
was at that time a branch of art little understood,
and the specific treatment of lunatics was worthy
of the barbarous age of medicine. The unhappy
patient” (King George III.) “upon whom this
most terrible visitation of Heaven had fallen,
was no longer dealt with as a human being.
His body was immediately enclosed in a machine,
which left it no liberty of motion. He was
sometimes chained to a staple. He was frequently
beaten and starved, and at least he was kept in
subjection by menacing and violent language.”
That, like most lunatics, he was very annoying
is certain; he once talked for nineteen hours
unceasing. But all his troubles were intensified
by ill-treatment;<a id='r692' /><a href='#f692' class='c010'><sup>[692]</sup></a> they left him to be knocked
about by a German servant,<a id='r693' /><a href='#f693' class='c010'><sup>[693]</sup></a> and the first
doctors kept him even from his own children, at
which the poor old man complained “very
heavily.”<a id='r694' /><a href='#f694' class='c010'><sup>[694]</sup></a> Such, then, was the orthodox treatment
applied against the highest in the land.
But the worst deeds were done behind thick
walls. “Sane people,” says Beach,<a id='r695' /><a href='#f695' class='c010'><sup>[695]</sup></a> writing of
private establishments, “were frequently confined
in these asylums, for persons frequently availed
themselves of the facilities<a id='r696' /><a href='#f696' class='c010'><sup>[696]</sup></a> then in use in order
to get rid of a troublesome relative or to obtain
some selfish object.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And what of the really mad?<a id='r697' /><a href='#f697' class='c010'><sup>[697]</sup></a>—irritable,
violent, irrational, helpless, often with as little
control over the functions of the body as on the
workings of the mind. We can imagine what
their state became when left in the hands of
ignorant practitioners and brutal attendants,
with chains and instruments of restraint convenient
and ready. Screened off from all kith
and kin they writhed with sores and rotted
in ordure.<a id='r698' /><a href='#f698' class='c010'><sup>[698]</sup></a> Sometimes—mostly on Monday
mornings after the Sabbath rest and accumulations—they
might be carried out into a yard<a href='#f698' class='c010'><sup>[698]</sup></a>
to be mopped and soused from pails in the
coldest weather.<a id='r699' /><a href='#f699' class='c010'><sup>[699]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The condition of the living rooms and wards<a id='r700' /><a href='#f700' class='c010'><sup>[700]</sup></a>
was often such that visitors grew physically
sick from going into them;<a id='r701' /><a href='#f701' class='c010'><sup>[701]</sup></a> but they were rare
within those private prisons,<a id='r702' /><a href='#f702' class='c010'><sup>[702]</sup></a> strangers are never
welcome behind the walls. At York Asylum<a id='r703' /><a href='#f703' class='c010'><sup>[703]</sup></a>—an
especial plague spot opened in 1777 and
burnt,<a id='r704' /><a href='#f704' class='c010'><sup>[704]</sup></a> it is said, to avoid disclosures that might
hang its keepers,<a id='r705' /><a href='#f705' class='c010'><sup>[705]</sup></a> in 1814—a rule was adopted
in 1813 “that no person<a id='r706' /><a href='#f706' class='c010'><sup>[706]</sup></a> shall be allowed to
visit any of the patients without a special
written order signed by the physitian.” Official
visitors were generally harmless.<a id='r707' /><a href='#f707' class='c010'><sup>[707]</sup></a> At York
the worst rooms were not shown them.<a id='r708' /><a href='#f708' class='c010'><sup>[708]</sup></a> For
most of the small asylums there were none
at all.<a id='r709' /><a href='#f709' class='c010'><sup>[709]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Even the larger public asylums during the
eighteenth, and also far into the nineteenth
century, were horrible monuments of cruelty
and neglect. The miserable patients lay upon
straw in cells,<a id='r710' /><a href='#f710' class='c010'><sup>[710]</sup></a> or upon wooden shelves to which
they were fastened. Many were naked or decked
over with one blanket.<a id='r711' /><a href='#f711' class='c010'><sup>[711]</sup></a> In the wards they
were frequently chained to the wall by wrist or
ankle,<a id='r712' /><a href='#f712' class='c010'><sup>[712]</sup></a> and occasionally by both. One patient
at Bethlem,<a id='r713' /><a href='#f713' class='c010'><sup>[713]</sup></a> a fierce, powerful man whose name
was Norris, after a fracas with a drunken
keeper, had his arms and shoulders encased in
a frame of iron obtained from Newgate.<a id='r714' /><a href='#f714' class='c010'><sup>[714]</sup></a> This
instrument<a id='r715' /><a href='#f715' class='c010'><sup>[715]</sup></a> was attached by a twelve-inch
chain to a collar round his neck, from a ring
round a vertical iron bar which had been
built into the wall by the head of his bed.<a id='r716' /><a href='#f716' class='c010'><sup>[716]</sup></a>
His right leg was secured to the frame upon
which he lay. The effect was that the patient
could move up and down as far as the ring and
short chain round the upright bar permitted,
but he could not stir one foot from the wall,
and could only rest lying upon his back. “In
this thraldom,” says Dr. Conolly,<a id='r717' /><a href='#f717' class='c010'><sup>[717]</sup></a> “he had lived
for twelve years. During much of this time he
is reported to have been rational in his conversation.
At length relief came, which he only lived
about a year to enjoy. It is painful to add that
this long-continued punishment had the recorded
approbation of all the authorities of the hospital.
Nothing can more forcibly illustrate the hardening
effect of being habitual witnesses of cruelty,
and the process which the heart of man undergoes
when allowed to exercise irresponsible
power.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The medical men were poorly paid and proportionately
neglectful. At the time of which
we are speaking—the end of the eighteenth
and the beginning of the nineteenth century—the
physician at Bedlam got only £100 a
year.<a id='r718' /><a href='#f718' class='c010'><sup>[718]</sup></a> However, he kept a private asylum,
and sometimes left the public institution for
months together.<a id='r719' /><a href='#f719' class='c010'><sup>[719]</sup></a> One of the surgeons is
described as having been “generally insane and
mostly drunk,” in spite of which he was retained
there for ten years.<a id='r720' /><a href='#f720' class='c010'><sup>[720]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>With such shameful neglect and callousness
on the part of the doctors—there appear to
have been no chaplains in those days<a id='r721' /><a href='#f721' class='c010'><sup>[721]</sup></a>—it is not
to be wondered that the unhappy patients fell
entirely into the hands of their keepers and
immediate attendants, and most of these were
quite ignorant people, rendered impatient and
brutal by the exasperating ways of the demented
inmates, and by their boundless power over
them. Instinctive and retaliative floggings (the
third kind, alluded to on p. 149), assaults, and
possibly even murders, were not uncommon, as
well as the distressing and unlimited restraints
already referred to.<a id='r722' /><a href='#f722' class='c010'><sup>[722]</sup></a> One doctor invented and
introduced a special instrument to prize open
the patients’ mouths at compulsory feeding.
He mentions that, by the usual process, teeth
were apt to be broken, and some were left
“without a front tooth in either jaw.”<a id='r723' /><a href='#f723' class='c010'><sup>[723]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>In the eighteenth century<a id='r724' /><a href='#f724' class='c010'><sup>[724]</sup></a>—up to 1770—and
in some places, doubtless, even to later times,
the mad people were reckoned among the
“sights.”<a id='r725' /><a href='#f725' class='c010'><sup>[725]</sup></a> The public paid<a id='r726' /><a href='#f726' class='c010'><sup>[726]</sup></a> to go round the
asylums, as they do now to gaze upon wild
beasts.<a id='r727' /><a href='#f727' class='c010'><sup>[727]</sup></a> The baser and more mischievous among
them would irritate and purposely enrage the
secured patients, as their descendants tease caged
animals to this day;<a id='r728' /><a href='#f728' class='c010'><sup>[728]</sup></a> and thus reproduced for
their ghastly diversion “exhibitions of madness
which are no longer to be found, because they
were not the simple product of malady, but of
malady aggravated by mismanagement.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Such conduct appears to have been general
in those times.<a id='r729' /><a href='#f729' class='c010'><sup>[729]</sup></a> At Geneva<a id='r730' /><a href='#f730' class='c010'><sup>[730]</sup></a> some lunatics
would be given grass and horrible things to eat
to amuse visitors. This also happened at the
Bicêtre,<a id='r731' /><a href='#f731' class='c010'><sup>[731]</sup></a> in certain parts of Germany, etc.<a id='r732' /><a href='#f732' class='c010'><sup>[732]</sup></a> “Les
Fous de Charenton” became, for a time, notorious
for their plays,<a id='r733' /><a href='#f733' class='c010'><sup>[733]</sup></a> which were presented with much
sound and fury, attracting spectators from very
grotesqueness. They were forbidden in 1811.</p>

<p class='c011'>High walls kept things dark for years, but
the light stole through in the end, as it always
will.<a id='r734' /><a href='#f734' class='c010'><sup>[734]</sup></a> In 1793 Pinel removed the chains from
patients in the Bicêtre. At home, the York
Asylum, already alluded to, began to bear an evil
reputation. In 1788 it incurred the <i>Animadversions</i><a id='r735' /><a href='#f735' class='c010'><sup>[735]</sup></a>
of the Rev. William Mason.<a id='r736' /><a href='#f736' class='c010'><sup>[736]</sup></a> In the
year 1791 some friends of a female patient desired
to visit her, but were not allowed, upon the plea
that she was not in a suitable condition to be
seen by strangers (she probably was not!) A
few weeks after this she was reported dead.<a id='r737' /><a href='#f737' class='c010'><sup>[737]</sup></a>
The woman belonged to the Society of Friends,
and the suspicious circumstances of her incarceration
caused much resentment among the Quakers.
Soon after, William Tuke resolved that they
should have a hospital of their own. The Retreat
was started in the year 1792, and its humane
and enlightened methods were soon contrasted
with the barbarous and secret administration
prevailing at the older institution. But the
years rolled by while patients languished and
died. It was in 1813 that Samuel Tuke—a
grandson of the founder of the Retreat—brought
out a little work<a id='r738' /><a href='#f738' class='c010'><sup>[738]</sup></a> describing the system there.
It “excited universal interest, and, in fact,
achieved what all the talents and public spirit
of Mason and his friends had failed to accomplish.
It had still better effects. A very inoffensive
passage in this book roused, it seems, the
animosity of the physician to York Lunatic
Asylum, and a letter which this gentleman
published in one of the York newspapers<a id='r739' /><a href='#f739' class='c010'><sup>[739]</sup></a>
became the origin of a controversy among
the governors of that establishment, which
terminated in August 1814, after a struggle
of nearly two years, in the complete overthrow
of the old system, and the dismission of every
officer of the asylum, except the physician
himself.”<a id='r740' /><a href='#f740' class='c010'><sup>[740]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The conflict was taken up by others and
carried on. Towards the close of that same
year (1813), a case of alleged misconduct was
brought forward by Mr. Godfrey Higgins, a
magistrate for the West Riding. “Mr. Higgins’
statement was read” (before twenty-seven
governors), “after which the accused servants
of the house were called in and sworn. They
denied upon oath the truth of the charges. No
other evidence was called for; nor was any
minute committed to writing of what had been
sworn by the servants. The following resolution
was passed:—The governors having taken into
consideration the statements published in the
York and other newspapers respecting the
treatment of William Vicars, lately a patient in
this asylum, ... are unanimously of opinion
that ... he was treated with all possible care,
attention, and humanity.”<a id='r741' /><a href='#f741' class='c010'><sup>[741]</sup></a> It was of no avail;
thirteen gentlemen of the county came forward
with donations, in virtue of which they qualified
as governors. These new men brought their
votes to bear to force on an inquiry, and though
the old gang of scoundrels never got their deserts,
and, to conceal their guilt, are said to have set
the premises on fire, yet they were driven out
of their situations, and soon investigation became
national.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1814 Mr. George Rose brought in a Bill
to regulate asylums, which passed the House
of Commons. But the authorities at Bedlam
opposed the measure,<a id='r742' /><a href='#f742' class='c010'><sup>[742]</sup></a> spending over £600 in
so doing. They had good cause, as we shall
see presently. The York Asylum governors—nineteen
of them, including the archbishop—sent
in a petition against it; and the intrepid
Mr. Higgins sent one in its favour, signed by
himself.<a id='r743' /><a href='#f743' class='c010'><sup>[743]</sup></a> The Bill was thrown out by the House
of Lords,<a id='r744' /><a href='#f744' class='c010'><sup>[744]</sup></a> but a committee of the House of
Commons was then appointed, and collected the
inconceivable and horrible evidence from which
we have quoted. Its report was presented by
Mr. Rose in 1815,<a id='r745' /><a href='#f745' class='c010'><sup>[745]</sup></a> and though the committee at
Bedlam formally exonerated its officials for all
things they had done and neglected to do, including
even the dreadful instrument placed
round Norris,<a id='r746' /><a href='#f746' class='c010'><sup>[746]</sup></a> the unofficial mind of the public
had been roused to indignation, and many of the
worst abuses were presently remedied.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Rose died in 1818, but in the following
year Mr. Wynn brought forward another Bill,
which was, however, opposed by Lord Eldon, who
observed<a id='r747' /><a href='#f747' class='c010'><sup>[747]</sup></a> that “there could not be a more false
humanity than over-humanity with regard to
persons afflicted with insanity,” a line of argument
which we shall come on again. That Bill
shared the fate of its predecessor. It was not
until nine years afterwards that Mr. Gordon
secured the passing of an Act<a id='r748' /><a href='#f748' class='c010'><sup>[748]</sup></a> to improve the
asylums, in the year 1828. Though abuses continued
into the middle of the nineteenth century,<a id='r749' /><a href='#f749' class='c010'><sup>[749]</sup></a>
and many Acts of Parliament were subsequently
brought in,<a id='r750' /><a href='#f750' class='c010'><sup>[750]</sup></a> the monstrous evils of which we
have spoken continued as crimes where previously
they had been customs, and took place on a much
diminished scale.</p>

<p class='c011'>At Lincoln Asylum,<a id='r751' /><a href='#f751' class='c010'><sup>[751]</sup></a> about 1838, Dr. Gardner
Hill removed mechanical restraints, and Dr.
Conolly<a id='r752' /><a href='#f752' class='c010'><sup>[752]</sup></a> followed at Hanwell in the succeeding
year. In this they were, of course, opposed
in the Profession,<a id='r753' /><a href='#f753' class='c010'><sup>[753]</sup></a> but new ideas and new
conceptions were coming, which are still working
in the treatment of insanity. All along,
heretofore, the Mind and the Body had been
conceived as two separate things. People
had ceased to believe in the interference of
devils, but they spoke vaguely of “a mind
diseased.” There being often no physical
injury that could be detected, “the common
opinion seemed to be confirmed that it”
(mental disorder) “was an incomprehensible,
and consequently an incurable, malady of the
mind.”<a id='r754' /><a href='#f754' class='c010'><sup>[754]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>A medical writer<a id='r755' /><a href='#f755' class='c010'><sup>[755]</sup></a> of the early nineteenth
century could allude to lectures he had attended,
at which the doctor had declared that treatment
and physic were useless in a case of <i>furor
uterinus</i>, because it was a disease of the mind, not
of the body. No doubt there loomed the fear of
Free Will and Theology. “... Many very able
men,” says Dr. Halliday,<a id='r756' /><a href='#f756' class='c010'><sup>[756]</sup></a> “led away by what
appeared to be the general opinion of mankind,
shrank from a strict investigation of a subject that
seemed to lead to a doubt of the immateriality
of mind, a truth so evident to their own feelings
and so expressly established by divine revelation.”
It is not for us to turn aside into labyrinths, or
to attempt to settle what “mind” may mean.
But we know that, to our present power of comprehension,
the mind can only function through
the body. How it first formed, and if it can yet
rekindle, are vital questions which may never be
answered; at any rate they lie beyond our range.</p>

<p class='c011'>Gradually metaphysics and moral concepts
were left behind as experts examined facts.
“... Derangement,” says a nineteenth-century
writer,<a id='r757' /><a href='#f757' class='c010'><sup>[757]</sup></a> “is no longer considered a disease of the
understanding, but of the centre of the nervous
system, upon the unimpaired condition of which
the exercise of the understanding depends. The
brain is at fault and not the mind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The old notion,” says Dr. Wynter,<a id='r758' /><a href='#f758' class='c010'><sup>[758]</sup></a> “that
derangement of mind may happen without any
lesion of the instrument of thought being the
cause or consequence, has long been exploded.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The physical origin of insanity “became
gradually accepted. Its mental phenomena were
more carefully observed, and its relation was
established to other mental conditions which had
not hitherto been regarded as insane in the
proper sense of the word.... Hitherto the
criteria of insanity had been very rude, and the
evidence was generally of a loose and popular
character; but whenever it was fully recognised
that insanity was a disease with which physicians
who had studied the subject were peculiarly
conversant, expert evidence obtained increased
importance, and from that time became prominent
in every case. The new medical views of insanity
were thus brought into contact with the old
narrow conceptions of the law courts, and a
controversy arose in the field of criminal law,
which, in England at least, is not yet settled.”<a id='r759' /><a href='#f759' class='c010'><sup>[759]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The instinct of retaliation was not readily
restrained by reasoning or proofs of irresponsibility.
In postulating freedom of choice under
all physical conditions; in assuming plenary
responsibility in men and women under all
circumstances; in refusing to recognise any
abnormal state unless it were so extreme and
obvious as to render the person before the court
unconscious of his actions and surroundings, the
judges were defending their own position. Thus
the new theories<a id='r760' /><a href='#f760' class='c010'><sup>[760]</sup></a> were disputed and sneered
at, and arbitrary standards as to sanity were
set up at variance with all facts and expert
evidence.<a id='r761' /><a href='#f761' class='c010'><sup>[761]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Some contended that the more subtle and
amazing forms of madness or abnormality perceived
by the specialists were but new names for
old perversities.<a id='r762' /><a href='#f762' class='c010'><sup>[762]</sup></a> Others averred that nothing
physical ought to exculpate. Smollett wished
that all lunatics guilty of grave offences might
be subjected “to the common penalties of the
law.” Upon this Mr. Tuke observes in comment
that “The entire inability to distinguish between
voluntary and involuntary acts, ... between
motives and consequences, is singularly well
shown. Unfortunately it was not peculiar to
Smollett.”<a id='r763' /><a href='#f763' class='c010'><sup>[763]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>And I might add that this instinctive feeling
continued—as everything instinctive generally
does. Turning to the work of a writer still
living (in 1908), we come upon the following:
“Of late years a certain school of thinkers<a id='r764' /><a href='#f764' class='c010'><sup>[764]</sup></a> ...
have started some theories respecting the responsibility
or irresponsibility of many dangerous
criminals and murderers, which have very properly
been objected to by more practical observers.”
And the writer continues with all the sweet
simplicity of ignorance: “Even the inmates of
lunatic asylums know well the distinction between
right and wrong. And it is precisely upon this
knowledge that the government and discipline of
such establishments are based. Hence no theories
of criminal irresponsibility should be permitted
to relax the security and strictness of the detention
of dangerous offenders, whether sane, or
partially insane, or wholly mad. And it is
important to observe that the treatment and
condition even of mad murderers should not be
made attractive to others outside.” But the
hard scientific facts persisted. Injustice and
cruelty, practised upon the weak and helpless,
do not, alas! and <i>pace</i> good Mrs. Stowe, bring
down upon nations the visible wrath of God;
but the manifest falseness of the old assumptions,
and the continued failure of the mediæval methods,
could not be hidden through unending years.
Slowly the light of science began to penetrate
into the dark places of punishment. The entirely
mad were first rescued and treated as patients,
and these now, happily, no longer concern us;
their case belongs to Medicine, not to Criminology.
With regard to the half-mad we are in a state of
slow change and transition. Their wrongs, long
known to the alienists, are being brought before
the law-makers. “Crime,” says the Report of
Mr. Secretary Gladstone’s Committee,<a id='r765' /><a href='#f765' class='c010'><sup>[765]</sup></a> “its causes
and treatment, has been the subject of much
profound and scientific inquiry. Many of the
problems it presents are practically at the present
time insoluble. It may be true that some
criminals are irreclaimable, just as some diseases
are incurable, and in such cases it is not unreasonable
to acquiesce in the theory that
criminality is a disease and the result of physical
imperfection. But criminal anthropology as a
science is in an embryo stage....” With
regard to the abnormal we are only on the
threshold of justice; a multitude of causes, theological
and instinctive, prevent the facts from
being faced and known.</p>

<p class='c011'>We may take comfort in the course of evolution;
in that the violently mad (employing the
word in a wide and general sense) are no longer
exorcised and tormented; in that the eccentrically
mad are no longer burned and tortured for
what was imagined against them; in that the
weak-minded and the partially deranged are
being considered, with a view to their segregation
in special places apart from healthy offenders;
in that innate and absolute abnormality of
emotions has been established by the specialists
upon overwhelming evidence; and that the
knowledge of this is quietly spreading, and being
recognised and admitted among educated people,
throughout the civilised world.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='label'><a href='#r416'>416</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Professor E. P. Evans throws an interesting side-light on this offence.
“It seems rather odd,” he observes, “that the Christian lawgivers should
have adopted the Jewish code against sexual intercourse with beasts, and
then enlarged it so as to include the Jews themselves. The question was
gravely discussed by jurists whether cohabitation of a Christian with a
Jewess, or <i>vice versa</i>, constitutes sodomy. Damhouder (<i>Prax. rer. crim.</i>
c. 96, n. 48) is of the opinion that it does, and Nicolaus Boër (<i>Decis</i>, 136,
n. 5) cites the case of a certain Johannes Alardus or Jean Alard who kept
a Jewess in his house in Paris and had several children by her; he was
convicted of sodomy on account of this relation and burned, together with
his paramour, ‘since coition with a Jewess is precisely the same as if a
man should copulate with a dog’ (<i>Döpl. Theat.</i> ii. p. 157). Damhouder
includes Turks and Saracens in the same category.”—<i>The Criminal
Prosecution and Capital Punishment of Animals</i>, p. 152. London, 1906.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
